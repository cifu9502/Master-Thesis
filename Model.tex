We now intend to study the transport properties through two QDs that
are coupled to a topological superconducting (TS) chain sustaining
a Majorana Bound State (MBS) as it is observe in \ref{Fig_2QD-Majorana}.
In \prettyref{sec:The-Numerical-Renormaliztion} we saw how the NRG
code can be applied to study the physics of transport through a QD.
In our case, we can set-up a similar Anderson-model to the one used
in \ref{eq:hamB0} taking

\[
H=H_{TS-2QDs}+H_{lead}+H_{int}=H_{M-QDs}+\sum_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}l}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}^{\dagger}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}+\sum_{il\sigma}V_{il}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}^{\dagger}d_{i\sigma}+V_{il}^{*}d_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}.
\]


with the new index $i\in\{1,2\}$ summing over both dots and $H_{TS-2QDs}$
representing the initial Hamiltonian system, which couples the two
Qds $\left(d_{1\sigma}^{\dagger},d_{2\sigma}^{\dagger}\right)$ with
the superconducting wire. The hamiltonian $H_{TS-2QDs}$ can be be
divided in three components

\[
H_{TS-2QDs}=H_{2QDs}+H_{int}+H_{TS}=H_{d_{i}}+\sum_{\sigma}\left(td_{1\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{2\sigma}+t^{*}d_{1\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{2\sigma}\right)+H_{int}+H_{TS}
\]


where $H_{d_{i}}$is the QD hamiltonian for dot $i$ \prettyref{eq:DotHam}
,$t$ is the hopping term between both dots, $H_{int}$is the dot-TS
interaction and $H_{TS}$ is the TS-hamiltonian . In \citep{vernek_subtle_2014},
the TS is modeled as a Kitaev chain \citep{kitaev_unpaired_2001}
and $H_{int}$ is the hopping interaction between dots and chain 

\begin{eqnarray}
H_{TS} & = & -\sum_{j=1}^{N}\mu a_{j}^{\dagger}a_{j}+\sum_{j=1}^{N-1}\left[-t'(a_{j}^{\dagger}a_{i+1}+a_{j+1}^{\dagger}a_{j})+\Delta a_{j}a_{j+1}+\Delta^{*}a_{j+1}^{\dagger}a_{j}^{\dagger}\right]\nonumber \\
H_{int} & = & \sum t_{i}d_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}a_{1}+t_{i}^{*}a_{1}^{\dagger}d_{i\downarrow},\label{eq:Kitaev-dot}
\end{eqnarray}


where $a_{j}^{\dagger}$is the creation operator at site $j$ of the
chain, $t'$ is the hopping term between consecutive sites, $\Delta$
is the superconducting gap and $t_{i}$ is the hopping interaction
between the dot $i$ and the first site of the chain. We also assume
the dot only interact with spin-down $\downarrow$ operators in the
chain. \\

Using a Green's function approach on \prettyref{eq:Kitaev-dot} ,
\citet{vernek_subtle_2014} concludes that the Majorana mode at the
end of the chain leaks inside the QD when the TS is in the topological
phase . This fact favors a more simple effective model that has been
used in literature for simulation QD-TS interactions \citep{liu_detecting_2011,golub_kondo_2011,lee_kondo_2013}.
The model consists in considering only the coupling between the dots
and the Majorana modes that emerge in the topological phase. The resulting
hamiltonian is 

\begin{eqnarray}
H_{TS} & = & 2\epsilon_{m}\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}\nonumber \\
H_{int} & = & \sum_{i}t_{i1}\left(d_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}\gamma_{1}+\gamma_{1}d_{i\downarrow}\right)+it_{i2}\left(d_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}\gamma_{2}+\gamma_{2}d_{i\downarrow}\right),\label{eq:Majorana-ham}
\end{eqnarray}


where $\gamma_{1,2}$are the two majorana operators and$t_{i1,2}$
are the hopping terms between the majoranas and the QDs.

The fidelity of this new model has been discussed by \citet{ruiz-tijerina_interaction_2015}
concluding that the majorana effective hamiltonian reproduces the
same results than the Kitaev chain model in the topological phase
(This statement is true even for more realistic models of the TS that
include Rashba spin-orbit interactions and a Zeeman field \citep{ruiz-tijerina_interaction_2015}
).\\

We now want to come back to a fermionic model, which was broken with
the introduction of majorana operators in the hamiltonian \prettyref{eq:Majorana-ham}.
For this we just need to replace the majorana operators $\gamma_{i}$
with their corresponding fermion operator

\[
f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\gamma_{1}-i\gamma_{2}\right)\ ,\ f_{\downarrow}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\gamma_{1}+i\gamma_{2}\right)
\]


so that 

\[
\gamma_{1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}+f_{\downarrow}\right)\ ,\gamma_{2}=\frac{1}{i\sqrt{2}}\left(f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}-f_{\downarrow}\right).
\]


Supposing $t_{i1}=\left|t_{i1}\right|$ and $t_{i2}=\left|t_{i2}\right|e^{i\phi_{i}}$
to have a $\phi_{i}$-phase with respect to $t_{i1}$, we get to the
following hamiltonian 

\begin{eqnarray*}
H_{TS} & = & 2\epsilon_{m}f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}f_{\downarrow}-\epsilon_{m}\\
H_{int} & = & \sum_{i}\tilde{t_{i-}}d_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}f_{\downarrow}+\tilde{t_{i-}}^{*}f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}d_{i\downarrow}+\tilde{t_{i+}}d_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}+\tilde{t_{i+}}^{*}f_{\downarrow}d_{i\downarrow}
\end{eqnarray*}


with $\tilde{t}_{i\pm}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|t_{i1}\right|-i\left|t_{i1}\right|e^{i\phi_{i}}\right).$
Therefore the final model for our initial hamiltonian is 

\begin{eqnarray}
H_{TS-2QDs} & = & H_{d_{i}}+\sum_{\sigma}\left(td_{1\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{2\sigma}+t^{*}d_{1\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{2\sigma}\right)\nonumber \\
 &  & \ \enskip\ \enskip+\sum_{i}\left[\tilde{t_{i-}}d_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}f_{\downarrow}+\tilde{t_{i-}}^{*}f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}d_{i\downarrow}+\tilde{t_{i+}}d_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}+\tilde{t_{i+}}^{*}f_{\downarrow}d_{i\downarrow}\right]+2\epsilon_{m}f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}f_{\downarrow}-\epsilon_{m}.\label{eqFinalMJ-2QDs}
\end{eqnarray}


The dimensionality of this system is $4\times4\times2=32.$ Again
we can write this hamiltonian by blocks using the preserved symmetries.
This time we can observe that the number of $\uparrow$-particles
$\left(N_{\uparrow}\right)$ is preserved in \ref{eqFinalMJ-2QDs},
but it is not for $\downarrow$-particles due to the terms $\left(d_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger},\ f_{\downarrow}d_{i\downarrow}\right)$.
However, the parity of $\downarrow$-particle $\left(P_{\downarrow}\right)$
is always preserved since $\left(d_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger},\ f_{\downarrow}d_{i\downarrow}\right)$
create or annihilate $2$-particles in the system. 

The final computations for $H_{TS-2QDs}$ in terms of the $N_{\uparrow},P_{\downarrow}$-symmetry
can be found in \prettyref{chap:Double-Dot-Majorana-Hamiltonian.}.
Setting $H_{-1}=H_{TS-2QDs}$ we can use the NRG algorithm \prettyref{eq:NRG-Iteration Hamiltonians}
to iteratively diagonalize this hamiltonian by 

\[
H_{N+1}=\Lambda^{\frac{1}{2}}\left[H_{N}+\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\Lambda^{-1}\right)\xi_{N}\left(f_{N\sigma}^{\dagger}f_{N+1,\sigma}+f_{N+1\sigma}^{\dagger}f_{N\sigma}\right)\right]\ \mbox{for \ensuremath{N\geq0}}.
\]


At $N=-1$ the equation above won't work since there are two QDs coupled
with the leads. The answer to this problem is simply to define constants
$\xi_{0i}$ that characterizes the coupling between dot $i$ and the
first opperator $f_{0}^{\dagger}.$ Thus we obtain 

\[
H_{0}=\Lambda^{\frac{1}{2}}\left[H_{-1}+\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\Lambda^{-1}\right)\sum_{i}\xi_{i0}\left(i_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}f_{0,\sigma}+f_{0\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{i\sigma}\right)\right]\ \mbox{for \ensuremath{N\geq0}}.
\]


This idea completes the NRG algorithm for the $2$QD-TS model coupled
to metallic lead. An NRG extension of the code developed by my thesis
advisor has been implemented \footnote{The code can be found in \url{https://github.com/cifu9502/nrgcode}}
and it is now in the error-correction stage. We hope for a rapid correction
of these errors to start running the program.
