\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This piece summarizes the main aspects of my work during the last two years in Brazil. It has been an enriching experience. I learned Portuguese and gotten a fantastic cultural exchange.  I also took advantage of the large condensed matter community in the country to participate in conferences, present my advances, and increase my knowledge on quantum mechanics. In my way, I met up to three Nobel prizes, one of them, Duncan Haldane, inspired me to study topological materials. Today, I look backwards and I get marveled by all the amazing things that happened and those who allowed me to live all of this.


 Therefore, in this brief statement I just want to thank all the amazing people that received me here in Brasil and made all of this possible:  My thesis advisor Prof. Luis Gregorio, who  suggested to me this project, helped enter into the USP and has guided me ever since with patience till this day. I thank my previous advisors, Andres and Cesar, and all my previous professors in Colombia who prepared for this life of research. I  to thank to my friends and my room partners, all of them have contributed to make this stage of my life here an amazing adventure. And finally, but also very important, I would like to thank to all my family and to that little cheek. Even from far away I have always felt their support, which endeavored me to pursue for this goal.

 I also acknowledge the financial support by CNPq (grants No. 307107/2013-2 and 449148/2014-9), and FAPESP (grant No. 2016/18495-4), which allowed us to present partial and complete results of this project in workshops and conferences. 

 

\begin{abstract}

Majorana zero modes (MZMs) emerging at the edges of topological superconducting wires are a promising platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Novel proposals use quantum dots (QDs) coupled to the end of these wires to detect Majorana signatures. This detection method provides the following advantages: 1) This device allows to study the prospective coexistence of Kondo-Majorana signatures, which have been recently reported in experiments.  2)  Today's precise experimental control over QDs offers the unique possibility of manipulating  MZMs inside multi-dot systems. This innovative idea has enlightened the design of scalable quantum architectures, bringing us closer to the implementation of a topological quantum computer. 

% These two features motivated our study Kondo-Majorana signatures in double quantum dots (DQD). 

The simplest case where Majorana manipulation is possible is in a double quantum dot (DQD). This system offers several possibilities for manipulation of MZMs, including different geometric configurations of the dots, from symmetric and  linear couplings to T-dot junctions. In this project, we perform a theoretical study  of the transitions of the Majorana signature in these geometries in non-interacting and interacting regimes. By tuning the dot's gate voltages, we will show that it is possible to control the localization of the MZM inside both dots.  We will also explore the interplay of these signatures with the Kondo effect, which emerges in non-interacting dots in superposition with the MZM.   

We adopt two methods in this project: 1) The Green equations of motion (EOM) allow us to obtain exact expressions for the density of states in coulomb-non-interacting systems. We present the Graph -Gauss-Jordan elimination process as a simple-graphical method to solve the emergent linear systems in the EOM. 2) We use Wilson's numerical renormalization group (NRG) in interacting systems, to study the combined Kondo-Majorana physics. We will test these methods, first in a double quantum dot (DQD) (\ref{chap: Methods}) and then in a QD-Majorana model (\ref{sec:QD-Majorana}), where we confirm the results of previous papers  \cite{dias_da_silva_transmission_2008,liu_detecting_2011,ruiz-tijerina_interaction_2015}.  Finally, we include the main contribution of this thesis, the study of a DQD coupled to a Majorana chain (\ref{chap:Results}).

O uso das quasi-particulas de Majorana que emergem nas bordas de um supercondutor topol\'ogico \'e uma plataforma promisora para computa\c{c}\~ao qu\^antica. Novas propostas usam quantum dots (QDs) para detectar sinais de Majorana. Este m\'etodo tem duas vantagens: 1) Os QDs  s\~ao os melhores dispositivos para estudar a co-exist\^encia de Kondo e Majorana, a qual t\^em sido reportada recentemente em experimentos. 2) O controle experimental preciso sobre os quantum dots que temos hoje em dia oferece a oportunidade \'unica para manipular quasi-part\'iculas de Majoranas dentro de sistemas com v\'arios dots. Esta ideia abriu novos caminhos para o desenho de arquiteturas qu\^anticas, nos aproximando do objetivo de implementar um computador qu\^antico topol\'ogico.


O caso mais simples em que se \'e poss\'ivel manipular tais quasi-part\'iculas \'e num quantum dot duplo (DQD). Este modelo oferece v\'arias possibilidades para mover os Majoranas, incluindo m\'ultiplas configura\c{c}\~oes geom\'etricas dos dots como acoplamentos sim\'etricos, lineares e em jun\c{c}\~oes T. Neste trabalho vamos apresentar uma an\'alise te\'orica das transi\c{c}\~es dos sinais de Majorana dentro do DQD em sistemas interagentes e n\~ao interagentes. Vamos ver que \'e poss\'ivel controlar a localiza\c{c}\~ao dos modos zero de Majorana  mediante o incremento nas voltagens de gate dos QDs. Tamb\'em vamos explorar como esses sinais interagem com o efeito Kondo que emerge em superposi\c{c}\~ao com o modo zero de Majorana.

Principalmente, vamos a usar dois m\'etodos neste projecto: 1) Usamos as equa\c{c}\~oes de movimento no formalismo de fun\c{c}\~oes de Green para  obter express\~oes exatas para a densidade de estados em sistemas n\~ao interagentes.  Vamos apresentar o m\'etodo the elimina\c{c}\~ao de Gauss-Jordan com grafos, o qual permite resolver rapidamente o sistema linear emergente nas equa\c{c}\~oes de movimento. 2) Em sistemas Coulomb interagentes usamos NRG, no qual poderemos observar a intera\c{c}\~ao entre o Majorana e o efeito Kondo. Vamos testar ambos os m\'etodos nos modelos de um double quantum dot e um QD acoplado com uma cadeia de Majorana, com o qual vamos reproduzir os resultados presentes na literatura. Finalmente, inclu\'imos a maior contribui\c{c}\~ao deste trabalho, o estudo de um DQD acoplado a uma cadeia de Majorana.

\chapter{Conclusions}


In this work, we developed two methods to study the system of a  double quantum dot attached to a Majorana chain. We probed successfully these methods in simpler cases such as the double quantum dot (\ref{sec:GreedDQD} , \ref{sec: NRG-DQD}) and the QD-Majorana system (\ref{sec:QD-Majorana}). The results obtained in these sections are in agreement with previous papers  regarding the Kondo interference in double quantum dots \cite{dias_da_silva_transmission_2008}, MZM leaking  into quantum dots \cite{,liu_detecting_2011} and the co-existence of Kondo-Majorana physics \cite{ruiz-tijerina_interaction_2015}. 

Moreover,  we introduced the Graph-Gauss-Jordan algorithm (\ref{sec:GraphMethod}) as a simple, didactic, analytical and graphical method to solve the equations of motion. This method allowed us to obtain exact expressions for the non-interacting Green functions at several stages of the project. In particular, in the double quantum dot - Majorana model it proved to be extremely useful to simplify the complexity of the solution given by a fractional polynomial of $9^\text{th}$-degree in up to 7 variables. Furthermore, with this expression we were able to predict interesting parameters for simulation in the interacting regime. We hope for its extended use in condensed matter physics.


In \ref{chap:Results} we used the methods from chapter \ref{chap: Methods} to study the transitions of the Majorana zero modes  inside a double quantum dot. Comparing the exact analytical solution in the non-interacting system and the NRG results for interacting quantum dots, we were able to characterized the displacements of the MZM inside the double quantum dot for the three setups in \ref{fig:MajoranaModels}, representing a symmetric coupling, a T-dot junction and a linear coupling of the dots. All of these manipulations are summarized in \ref{fig:ResultModels} . We observe a considerable agreement regarding the location of the Majorana signature between the interacting and non-interacting results with minor differences: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Symmetric coupling \ref{fig:ResultModels} C.I : The MZM leaks inside both dots. For interacting dots, the Majorana signature will emerge near the Kondo temperature.   At this regime the system presents combined Kondo-Majorana physics . Additional satellite peaks produced by the indirect exchange through the lead and the MZM appear at low energies. If the gate voltage of one dot is turned on the MZM is induced to tunnel only into the other dot, which is the key to MZM manipulation. 
    \item T-dot coupling \ref{fig:ResultModels} C.II: The the spin-$\up$ zero mode at QD1 (The Kondo peak if the system is interacting) is destroyed by quantum interference with the second dot. This interference will also destroy the MZM in the first dot but a type I Majorana signature will still appear in the second dot. The Majorana mode can be induced to tunnel back into the first dot if a gate voltage is applied on the second dot. This signature is visible at very low energies (bellow $0.1\Gamma_1$) in the interacting case. 
    \item Dots coupled in series \ref{fig:ResultModels} C.III : An indirect type II Majorana signature is observed in the first dot. This signature is robust, specially in the interacting case, where it is present in all configurations, despite gate voltage tunning. Fano resonances emerge in the second dot. One of them seems to have critical behavior. 

\end{itemize}

    \end{figure}

Besides MZM manipulation we also pointed out other cases that could lead to future projects, such as the separation of the exchange interactions produced through the lead and through the MZM, the emergence of an indirect Majorana signature passing through the leads and the critical behavior in the T-dot junction when a gate voltage is applied on the second dot.
