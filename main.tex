\begin{abstract}

Majorana zero modes (MZMs) appearing at the edges of topological superconducting wires are a promising platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Novel proposals use MZMs tunneling inside quantum dots (QDs) to implement quantum architectures because today's precise experimental control over the QD parameters offers the unique possibility of manipulating the Majoranas inside multi-dot systems. 
In addition, recent experimental works reporting the detection of such quasi-particles together with Kondo anomalies ,  including a recent paper published by the advisor of this dissertation and collaborators \citep{ruiz-tijerina_interaction_2015}, set out to explore the interplay of such Majorana zero-modes with the Kondo effect. The simplest case where Majorana manipulation is possible is in a double quantum dot (DQD). This model shows several possibilities for manipulation of MZM, including different geometric couplings such as  linear and T junctions. In this project we perform analytical (non-interacting) and numerical(interacting) quantum transport studies of the transition of the Majorana signature. By tuning the model parameters we show that it is possible to control the localization of the MZM inside the DQD and explore its interplay with the Kondo effect.

% In the last decades the interest in  the expectations on the pursuit
% of Majorana fermions in condensed matter systems have increased due to positive experimental results and promising applications in quantum computing. As recently as 2012,  experimental works reporting the detection of such quasiparticles  including a recent paper published by the advisor of this dissertation and collaborators \citep{ruiz-tijerina_interaction_2015}, set out to explore the interplay of such Majorana zero-modes with strongly interacting systems such as semiconductor quantum dots, which can be readily integrated in the device. This research project aims to
% expand this idea using the numerical renormalization group  to study the model of a  double quantum dot coupled to metallic leads and to a topological superconductor supporting edge Majorana zero modes (MZMs).   This simple model allows the manipulation of the MZMs bringing possible applications to braiding procedures . In addition, we will study the interplay of Kondo correlations, exchange interactions and Majorana physics.

\chapter{Conclusions}


In this work, we developed two methods to study the system of a  double quantum dot attached to a Majorana chain. We probed successfully these methods in simpler cases such as the double quantum dot (\ref{sec:GreedDQD} , \ref{sec: NRG-DQD}) and the QD-Majorana system (\ref{sec:QD-Majorana}). The results obtained in these sections are in agreement with previous papers  regarding the Kondo interference in double quantum dots \cite{dias_da_silva_transmission_2008}, MZM leaking  into quantum dots \cite{,liu_detecting_2011} and the co-existence of Kondo-Majorana physics \cite{ruiz-tijerina_interaction_2015}. 

Moreover,  we introduced the Graph-Gauss-Jordan algorithm (\ref{sec:GraphMethod}) as a simple, didactic, analytical and graphical method to solve the equations of motion. This method allowed us to obtain exact expressions for the non-interacting Green functions at several stages of the project. In particular, in the double quantum dot - Majorana model it proved to be extremely useful to simplify the complexity of the solution given by a fractional polynomial of $9^\text{th}$-degree in up to 7 variables. Furthermore, with this expression we were able to predict interesting parameters for simulation in the interacting regime. We hope for its extended use in condensed matter physics.


In \ref{chap:Results} we used the methods from chapter \ref{chap: Methods} to study the transitions of the Majorana zero modes  inside a double quantum dot. Comparing the exact analytical solution in the non-interacting system and the NRG results for interacting quantum dots, we were able to characterized the displacements of the MZM inside the double quantum dot for the three setups in \ref{fig:MajoranaModels}, representing a symmetric coupling, a T-dot junction and a linear coupling of the dots. All of these manipulations are summarized in \ref{fig:ResultModels} . We observe a considerable agreement regarding the location of the Majorana signature between the interacting and non-interacting results with minor differences: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] Symmetric coupling \ref{fig:ResultModels} C.I : The MZM leaks inside both dots. For interacting dots, the Majorana signature will emerge near the Kondo temperature.   At this regime the system presents combined Kondo-Majorana physics . Additional satellite peaks produced by the indirect exchange through the lead and the MZM appear at low energies. If the gate voltage of one dot is turned on the MZM is induced to tunnel only into the other dot, which is the key to MZM manipulation. 
    \item[]T-dot coupling \ref{fig:ResultModels} C.II: The the spin-$\up$ zero mode at QD1 (The Kondo peak if the system is interacting) is destroyed by quantum interference with the second dot. This interference will also destroy the MZM in the first dot but a type I Majorana signature will still appear in the second dot. The Majorana mode can be induced to tunnel back into the first dot if a gate voltage is applied on the second dot. This signature is visible at very low energies (bellow $0.1\Gamma_1$) in the interacting case. 
    \item[]Dots coupled in series \ref{fig:ResultModels} C.III : An indirect type II Majorana signature is observed in the first dot. This signature is robust, specially in the interacting case, where it is present in all configurations, despite gate voltage tunning. Fano resonances emerge in the second dot. One of them seems to have critical behavior. 

\end{itemize}

Besides MZM manipulation we also pointed out other cases that could lead to future projects, such as the separation of the exchange interactions produced through the lead and through the MZM, the emergence of an indirect Majorana signature passing through the leads and the critical behavior in the T-dot junction when a gate voltage is applied on the second dot.
