	abstract = {How localized electrons interact with delocalized electrons is a central question to many problems in sold-state physics1,2,3. The simplest manifestation of this situation is the Kondo effect, which occurs when an impurity atom with an unpaired electron is placed in a metal2. At low temperatures a spin singlet state is formed between the unpaired localized electron and delocalized electrons at the Fermi energy. Theories predict4,5,6,7 that a Kondo singlet should form in a single-electron transistor (SET), which contains a confined ‘droplet’ of electrons coupled by quantum-mechanical tunnelling to the delocalized electrons in the transistor's leads. If this is so, a SET could provide a means of investigating aspects of the Kondo effect under controlled circumstances that are not accessible in conventional systems: the number of electrons can be changed from odd to even, the difference in energy between the localized state and the Fermi level can be tuned, the coupling to the leads can be adjusted, voltage differences can be applied to reveal non-equilibrium Kondo phenomena7, and a single localized state can be studied rather than a statistical distribution. But for SETs fabricated previously, the binding energy of the spin singlet has been too small to observe Kondo phenomena. Ralph and Buhrman8 have observed the Kondo singlet at a single accidental impurity in a metal point contact, but with only two electrodes and without control over the structure they were not able to observe all of the features predicted. Here we report measurements on SETs smaller than those made previously, which exhibit all of the predicted aspects of the Kondo effect in such a system.},

	title = {Spectroscopic manifestations of the Kondo effect on single adatoms},
	journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
	annote = {The present topical review focuses on recent advances concerning an intriguing
	phenomenon in condensed matter physics, the scattering of conduction electrons at the
	localized spin of a magnetic impurity: the Kondo effect. Spectroscopic signatures
	of this effect have been observed in the past by high-resolution photoemission
	which, however, has the drawback of averaging over a typical surface area of
	1 mm2. By combining the atomic-scale spatial resolution of the scanning
	tunneling microscope (STM) with an energy resolution of a few tens of
	µeV 
	achievable nowadays in scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), and by exposing the
	magnetic adatom to external magnetic fields, our understanding of the interaction of a
	single magnetic impurity with the conduction electrons of the nonmagnetic host has been
	considerably deepened. New insight has emerged by taking advantage of quantum size
	effects in the metallic support and by decoupling the magnetic adatom from the
	supporting host metal, for instance by embedding it inside a molecule or by separating
	it by an ultrathin insulating film from the metal surface. In this way, Kondo
	resonances and Kondo temperatures can be tailored and manipulated by changing the
	local density of states of the environment. In the weak coupling limit between a
	Kondo impurity and a superconductor only a convolution of tip and sample DOS is
	observed while for strongly coupled systems midgap states appear, indicating
	superconducting pair breaking. Magnetic impurities with co-adsorbed hydrogen
	on metallic surfaces show pseudo-Kondo resonances owing to very low-energy
	vibrational excitations detected by inelastic tunneling spectroscopy. One of the most
	recent achievements in the field has been the clarification of the role of magnetic
	anisotropy in the Kondo effect for localized spin systems with a spin larger than
	S = 1/2.}

When applied to the Kondo problem, this numerical renormalization group (NRG) method gave for the first time the full crossover from the high-temperature phase of a free spin to the low-temperature phase of a completely screened spin. The NRG method was later generalized to a variety of quantum impurity problems. The purpose of this review is to give a brief introduction to the NRG method, including some guidelines for calculating physical quantities, and to survey the development of the NRG method and its various applications over the last 30 years. These applications include variants of the original Kondo problem such as the non-Fermi-liquid behavior in the two-channel Kondo model, dissipative quantum systems such as the spin-boson model, and lattice systems in the framework of the dynamical mean-field theory.},

In this talk we survey recent progress on the design of provably fast algorithms

algorithms motivate and rely upon fascinating primitives in graph theory, including
low-stretch spanning trees, graph sparsifiers, ultra-sparsifiers, and local
graph clustering. These are all connected by a definition of what it means for one
graph to approximate another. While this definition is dictated by Numerical
Linear Algebra, it proves useful and natural from a graph theoretic perspective.},

	abstract = {The transport coefficients of the Anderson model are calculated by extending Wilson's numerical renormalization group method to finite-temperature Green functions. Accurate results for the frequency and temperature dependence of the single-particle spectral densities and transport time tau ( omega , T) are obtained and used to extract the temperature dependence of the transport coefficients in the strong-correlation limit of the Anderson model. Results are obtained for values of the local level position ranging from the Kondo regime to the mixed valency and empty orbital regimes. The low-temperature anomalies in the resistivity, rho (T), thermopower, S(T), thermal conductivity, kappa (T), and Hall coefficient, R H (T), are discussed in terms of the behaviour of the spectral densities. At low temperature all quantities exhibit the expected Fermi liquid behaviour, rho (T)= rho 0 (1-c(T/T K ) 2 ), S(T) approximately gamma T, kappa (T)/ alpha T=1+ beta (T/T K ) 2 , R H (T)=-R infinity (1- delta (T/T K ) 2 ). Analytic results based on Fermi liquid theory are derived here for the first time for beta and the numerical results are shown to be consistent with this coefficient. The range of temperatures over which universal behaviour extends is also discussed. Scattering of conduction electrons in higher-angular-momentum, l{\textgreater}0, channels is also considered and an expression is derived for the corresponding transport time and used to discuss the influence of the interference terms between the resonant l=0 and non-resonant l=1 channels on the transport properties. The presence of non-resonant scattering is shown to be particularly important for the thermopower at half filling, where the sign of the thermopower can depend sensitively on the non-resonant phase shift. Finally the relation of the results to experiment is discussed.},

It is emphasized that the condition for the magnetic state depends on the Coulomb (i.e., exchange self-energy) integral, and that the usual type of exchange alone is not large enough in d-shell ions to allow magnetic moments to be present. We show that the susceptibility and specific heat due to the inner shell electrons show strongly contrasting behavior even in the nonmagnetic state. A calculation including degenerate d orbitals and d−d exchange shows that the orbital angular momentum can be quenched, even when localized spin moments exist, and even on an isolated magnetic atom, by kinetic energy effects.},

The applied method probes quantum states by the virtual cotunneling of two electrons and hence resolves the sequences of molecular states simultaneously. This result is achieved by weakly probing the quantum system through parallel contacts to its constituting quantum dots. The overlap of the dots' wave functions and, in turn, the splitting of molecular states are adjusted by the direct influence of coupling electrodes.},

	abstract = {The partition function of a two-dimensional "ferromagnetic" with scalar "spins" (Ising model) is computed rigorously for the case of vanishing field. The eigenwert problem involved in the corresponding computation for a long strip crystal of finite width (n atoms), joined straight to itself around a cylinder, is solved by direct product decomposition; in the special case n=∞ an integral replaces a sum. The choice of different interaction energies (±J,±J′) in the (0 1) and (1 0) directions does not complicate the problem. The two-way infinite crystal has an order-disorder transition at a temperature T=Tc given by the condition sinh(2JkTc) sinh(2J′kTc)=1. The energy is a continuous function of T; but the specific heat becomes infinite as −log {\textbar}T−Tc{\textbar}. For strips of finite width, the maximum of the specific heat increases linearly with log n. The order-converting dual transformation invented by Kramers and Wannier effects a simple automorphism of the basis of the quaternion algebra which is natural to the problem in hand. In addition to the thermodynamic properties of the massive crystal, the free energy of a (0 1) boundary between areas of opposite order is computed; on this basis the mean ordered length of a strip crystal is (exp (2JkT) tanh(2J′kT))n.},

dealing with various properties of quantum dots.
Small quantum dots with a large level spacing
are very well described by the Anderson impurity model.
In modern quantum dot experiments all parameters of this model can be tuned via external gate voltages. Thus, it should be possible to check our theoretical findings experimentally. 
We are particularly interested in temperatures \$T\$ smaller than the so-called Kondo temperature \$T\_K\$, \$T{\textless}T\_K\$. The Kondo temperature \$T\_K\$ is an energy scale below
which a local spin inside the dot interacts strongly with the conduction electrons in its neighboring leads.
Consequently we employ Wilson's numerical renormalization group method, a numerical technique which allows for an accurate calculation of properties of quantum dots in the Kondo regime.},

Ledentsov Institute of Solid State Physics, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany Quantum dots are nanometer-size semiconductor structures, and represent one of the most rapidly developing areas of current semiconductor research as increases in the speed and decreases in the size of semiconductor devices become more important. They present the utmost challenge to semiconductor technology, making possible fascinating novel devices. This important new reference book focuses on the key phenomena and principles. Chapter 1 provides a brief account of the history of quantum dots, whilst the second chapter surveys the various fabrication techniques used in the past two decades, and introduces the concept of self-organized growth. This topic is expanded in the following chapter, which presents a broad review of self-organization phenomena at surfaces of crystals. Experimental results on growth of quantum dot structures in many different systems and on their structural characterization are presented in Chapter 4. Basic properties of the dots relate to their geometric structure and chemical composition. Numerical modeling of the electronic and optical properties of real dots is presented in Chapter 5, together with general theoretical considerations on carrier capture, relaxation, recombination and properties of quantum dot lasers. Chapters 6 and 7 summarize experimental results on electronic, optical and electrical properties. The book concludes by disoussing highly topical results on quantum-dot-based photonic devices - mainly quantum dot lasers. Quantum Dot Heterostructures is written by some of the key researchers who have contributed significantly to the development of the field, and have pioneered both the theoretical understanding of quantum dot related phenomena and quantum dot lasers. It is of great interest to graduate and postgraduate students, and to researchers in semiconductor physics and technology and optoelectronics.},

	abstract = {The temperature-dependent impurity susceptibility for the symmetric Anderson model is calculated for all physically relevant values of its parameters U (the Coulomb correlation energy) and Γ (the impurity-level width). It is shown that, when U{\textgreater}πΓ, for temperatures T{\textless}U(10kB) the symmetric Anderson model exhibits a local moment and that its susceptibility maps neatly onto that of the spin-½ Kondo model with an effective coupling given by ρJeff=−8ΓπU. Furthermore, this mapping is shown for remarkably large values of {\textbar}ρJeff{\textbar}. At very low temperatures (much smaller than the Kondo temperature) the local moment is frozen out, just as for the Kondo model, leading to a strong-coupling regime of constant susceptibility at zero termperature. The results also depict the formation of a local moment from the free orbital as T drops below U, a feature not present in the Kondo model. Finally, when U≪πΓ there is a direct transition from free-orbital regime for T≫Γ to the strong-coupling regime for T≪Γ. The calculations were performed using the numerical renormalization group originally developed by Wilson for the Kondo problem. In addition to the actual numerical calculations, analytic results are presented. In particular, the effective Hamiltonians, i.e., fixed-point Hamiltonian plus relevant and marginal operators, are constructed for the free-orbital, local-moment, and strong-coupling regimes. Analytic formulas for the impurity susceptibility and free energy in all three regimes are developed. The impurity specfic heat in the strong-coupling regime is calculated.},
