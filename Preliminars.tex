In this preliminary chapter we will give a brief description description about transport processes in quantum dots (QDs). We will discuss basic aspects about single electron transistors, the application of the Anderson impurity model in QDs and the subsequent emergence of the Kondo effect, one of the main condensed matter problems of the $20^{th}$-century.

Quantum mechanical effects are visible when the system size is of the order of the de Broglie wavelength \citep[(1.1)]{bimberg_quantum_1999}
\[
\lambda_{f}=\frac{h}{\sqrt{3m_{\mathsf{eff}}k_{B}T}}
\]
 where $m_{\mathsf{eff}}$ is the electron effective mass in the crystal. Since $m_{\mathsf{eff}}$ can be much smaller than the free electron mass in some semiconducting materials, size quantization effects can be observed at system of sizes $\sim100\mbox{nm}$ \cite{sindel_numerical_2005}. A $0$D quantum system is a device confined in the three spacial dimensions up to this length-scale. This type of device receive the name of quantum dot (QD).

  Nowadays, QDs can be manufactured in different substracts, geometries and  and orientations \citep{bimberg_quantum_1999}. They can be integrated in structures like double quantum dots (\ref{fig:QD}(a)) or can even be grown vertical to the based 2D-electron gas (\ref{fig:QD}(b)). The precise experimental control over these devices allows to design atom-like structures with tunable energy levels. This has important applications on laser physics and in the implementation of single electron transistors. 
  % According to their orientation with respect to the based 2D-plane  two main types of QDs can be distinguished : Vertical (Figure \ref{QD-figuresA}) and lateral (Figure \ref{QD-figuresB}) QDs. 


  

   Ideally, the energy spectrum of a QD is a discrete set of energy levels resembling the spectrum of an atom. This atom-like structure is usually connected to three main gates (See \ref{fig:QD-Trans}(a)). Two of them are the source and the drain with voltages $V_S$ and $V_D$, used to control the electric gradient through the QD. When the QD is connected to these leads these energy levels are hybridized with respect to a broadening parameter $\Gamma$ which increases as the square of the source-drain voltage $V_{SD}$ 
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma \propto \pi \Vert V_{SD} \Vert^2
\end{equation}
\noindent This broadening is depicted in \ref{fig:specDots}. Ideally, $\Gamma \ll \Delta E$ is smaller enough such that the energy levels do not overlap each other. 

The third gate is the gate voltage $V_G$ which allows to tune the energy levels of the dot with high  precision. With this three gates it is possible to execute transport measurements through a QD . An electron can pass from the source to the drain if there is an energy level in the middle of the two voltages, just as in \ref{fig:QD-Trans}(a). If this condition is not satisfied,  the dot enters into a Coulomb blockade region without  electron transport between both leads as can be observed in \ref{fig:QD-Trans}(b)). Inside the Coulomb blockade regions (black diamonds) the number of electrons is constant. When increasing $V_G$ a single electron enters into the dot each time the system makes a transition between blockade regions. Since all of these effects can be controlled precisely with the gate voltage, the system described is indeed a single electron transistor (SET).  

Note that when $V_{SD}=0$, the condition for conductance can still be satisfied if there is an hybridized state at the level of $V_S = V_D$,  the Fermi energy. This situation receives the name of zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). The effects that can cause robust ZBCPs are quite interesting. In this thesis were will study two of them. The Kondo effect and the Majorana zero modes. 






% Indeed we can model an ideal single-electron QD as a quantum well
% with a negative constant potential inside the dot . For example an

% 0 & r\geq R
% \end{cases}.

\section{The Anderson Model \label{sec:Anderson}}
% The key ingredient in the Kondo phenomena is the presence of magnetic impurities whose states are hybridized to conduction electron in the metal. To study this idea the physics Nobel prize winner Philip Anderson created a model that simulated the quantum interaction between the impurity and the conduction band \citep{anderson_localized_1961}. The Anderson Model can be applied to different problems. In this thesis we are mainly interested in the study of artificially manufacture impurities better known as quantum dots.   

 %Here the study of the  magnetic impurities in metals responsible for the Kondo effect, as well as artificial impurities like quantum dots. 
 The Anderson model is used to describe quantum impurity systems \citep{anderson_localized_1961}. A quantum dot attached to a metallic lead is basically an artificial impurity that can be experimentally designed, modified and manipulated. Hence QDs are the perfect type of structure to test the Anderson mode.   

 Due to the small confinement space inside these dots,  Coulomb repulsion is relevant. However, it is usually impossible to provide a complete analytical description of these kind of systems due to the high correlations generated by this factor. Instead, we can obtain an overall description of the transport through the impurity by neglecting this Coulomb repulsion. This will allow us to obtain some analytic intuition of the models  before adventuring with long-lasting numerical simulations of interacting models. During this thesis, we will consider these two regimes as follows
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Non-interacting systems:} Coulomb repulsion is not relevant . In this case, spin-$\uparrow$ and spin-$\dw$ channels are independent. They can be solved analytically through the equations of motion (\ref{sec:transport}). 

    \item \textbf{Interacting systems:} The Coulomb repulsion is relevant. The repulsion factor will be defined by the factor $U$ which will take a fix value during the entire project. In this case, spin-$\uparrow$ and spin-$\dw$ channels are not independent since the Coulomb repulsion limits the number of particles inside each dot. We will use the Numerical Renormalization Group to treat this case. The intuition acquired from non-interacting systems will help us to select the input parameters of the algorithm.  
\end{itemize}


%The Anderson model takes in account both regimes and  the only difference in each case will be the value of $U$ parameter ($U=0$ non-interacting , $U>0$ interacting). 

To begin the description of the Anderson model, first consider that we have a QD (impurity) coupled to the conduction band of a metallic lead. We will define a Coulomb repulsion factor $U_i$, which will be set to $0$ if the system is non-interacting . Using the Hund rules, we know that the energy levels inside the dot should be filled from lower to higher energies with two electrons with different spin at each state. Each pair of electrons will interact magnetically and electrically. In addition, there is and energy term associated to each electron and a Zeeman splitting factor in case a $\hat{z}$-directed magnetic field $B$ is placed.  Considering these interactions, we can obtain a very general expression in second quantization for the QD Hamiltonian
of the form \citep[(3.2)]{sindel_numerical_2005}

\begin{equation}
H_{d}=\sum_{i\sigma}\epsilon_{i}d_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{i\sigma}+\sum_{i}U_{i}\hat{n}_{i\uparrow}\hat{n}_{i\downarrow}+\sum_{\sigma\sigma',i\neq j}U_{ij}\hat{n}_{i\sigma}\hat{n}_{j\sigma'}-\mu_{B}gB\sum_{i}S_{i}^{z}+J\sum_{i\neq j}\mathbf{S}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{j},
\end{equation}




\noindent where $\sigma\in\{\uparrow,\downarrow\}$, $d_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}\left(d_{i\sigma}\right)$
is the dot creation(annihilation) operator,$\hat{n}_{i\sigma}:=d_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{i\sigma}$
is the particle number, $\mathbf{S}_{i}$ is the spin-vector, $\epsilon_{i}$
is the energy of the $i^{\mbox{th}}$-level in the dot, $U_{i}$ is
the Coulomb repulsion between electrons in the same energy level $i$,
$U_{ij}$ is the Coulomb interaction between electrons in different
levels (And therefore smaller than $U_{i}$), \textbf{$B$} is an
applied magnetic field in the $\hat{z}$-direction causing a Zeeman splitting and $J$ is the
term representing the spin coupling between distinct levels

At low temperatures, the quantum interactions occur only with the closest energy level to the Fermi energy. Hence, we can make a single-level approximation, neglecting the other energy levels. Hence, we can set the parameters $U_i=U_{ij}=0$ and $J=0$ , which significantly reduces the complexity of the dot Hamiltonian \\


\begin{equation}
    H_{d}=\sum_{\sigma}\epsilon_{}d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{\sigma}+U\hat{n}_{\uparrow}\hat{n}_{\downarrow}-\mu_{B}gBS^{z}. \label{eq:hdot}
\end{equation}

Besides to the dot Hamiltonian, we need to consider the energy of the electrons in the lead $H_{lead}$ and the dot-lead interaction $H_{int}$. We can model  the conduction band of the lead as an electron gas with the following Bloch Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H_{lead}  =  \sum_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}l}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}^{\dagger}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}. 
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbf{k}$ represents the possible crystal momentums in the
leads, $l\in\{S,D\}$, $c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}^{\dagger}(c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l})$
creates(annihilates) an electron with momentum $\mathbf{k}$ and spin
$\sigma$ in the lead $l$, $\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}l}$ is the energy
of the electron in the leads. 

On the other hand, the interaction between the dot and the leads is then given by 
\begin{equation}
H_{int} = \sum_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}V_{\mathbf{k}l}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}^{\dagger}d_{\sigma}+V_{\mathbf{k}l}^{*}d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l},
\end{equation}
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%H_{lead} & = & \sum_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}l}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}^{\dagger}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}\\

%\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent where $V_{\mathbf{k}l}$ is a hopping exchange
term between the leads and the QD. 


The sum of these three interactions receives the name of Anderson Model. 
\begin{eqnarray}
H & = & H_{d}+H_{lead}+H_{int}\nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{\sigma}\epsilon_{}d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{\sigma}+U\hat{n}_{\uparrow}\hat{n}_{\downarrow}-\mu_{B}gBS^{z}+\sum_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}l}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}^{\dagger}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}+\sum_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}V_{\mathbf{k}l}c_{k\sigma l}^{\dagger}d_{\sigma}+V_{\mathbf{k}l}^{*}d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}.\label{eq:Anderson}
\end{eqnarray}

In this project, we will make two extra modifications to this system. Using the anti-commutation properties of the fermion operators

% \begin{equation}
% H=H_{d}+H_{lead}+H_{int}=\sum_{\sigma}\epsilon_{}d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{\sigma}+U\hat{n}_{\uparrow}\hat{n}_{\downarrow}+\sum_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}l}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}^{\dagger}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}+V_{\mathbf{k}l}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}^{\dagger}d_{\sigma}+V_{\mathbf{k}l}^{*}d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma l}.\label{eq:hamB0}
% \end{equation}
\[
\left\{ d_{\sigma}^{\dagger},d_{\sigma'}\right\} =\delta_{\sigma\sigma'}\ ,\ \left\{ d_{\sigma}^{\dagger},d_{\sigma'}^{\dagger}\right\} =\left\{ d_{\sigma},d_{\sigma'}\right\} =0,
\]
\noindent we get


\begin{eqnarray*}
\left(d_{\up}^{\dagger}d_{\up}+d_{\down}^{\dagger}d_{\down}-1\right){}^{2} & = & \sum_{\sigma}\left(d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{\sigma}\right)^{2}-2\sum_{\sigma}d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{\sigma}+2d_{\up}^{\dagger}d_{\up}d_{\down}^{\dagger}d_{\down}-1\\
 & = & 2d_{\up}^{\dagger}d_{\up}d_{\down}^{\dagger}d_{\down}-\sum_{\sigma}d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{\sigma}-1.
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent And replacing this in \eqref{eq:hdot} we obtain a  nice spin-symmetric form of the dot Hamiltonian

\begin{equation}
    \left(\epsilon_{}+\frac{U}{2}\right)d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{\sigma}+\frac{U}{2}(d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{\sigma}-1)^{2}-\mu_{B}gBS^{z}. 
    \label{eq:hdot2}
\end{equation}

In addition, it is possible to do a linear transform to the lead operators 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{V_{S}^{2}+V_{R}^{2}}}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
V_{S} & V_{R}\\
-V_{R} & V_{S}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma S}\\
c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma D}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma+}\\
c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma-}
\end{array}\right].
\end{equation}
\noindent After this transformation the operator will be decoupled from the dot Hamiltonian $c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma-}$ . This implies that we can suppose that the  dot is coupled with just one lead. In the following chapters we will maintain this convention.

\section{The Kondo Effect \label{sec:Kondo} }

\end{figure}


The Kondo effect is still regarded as one of the biggest condensed matter problems in the 20th century. There was an uncountable number of experimental and theoretical physicist that contributed to this problem . The most renown are probably the physicists Jacques Friedel, Jun Kondo and the two Nobel prizes Philip Anderson and Kenneth Wilson \citep{hewson_kondo_1997}. 

The history of the Kondo effect began in the early 1930s. By that time it was known that the resistivity of a metal is regulated by different scattering interactions against lattice phonon vibrations $\rho_{phonon} \sim T^5$, other electrons $\sim T^2$ and static impurities, which is temperature independent. The form of these contribution clearly implies that the resistivity should decay uniformly with a decreasing temperature. Nevertheless, some groundbreaking experiments revealed the observation of a resistance minimum in some metals at temperatures lower than $10K$ \cite{Kondo_deBoer1934}(See \ref{fig:Kondo} (a)). 

This phenomenon intrigued the scientific community for the following decades until the year 1964 when the physicist  Jun Kondo gave the first convincing solution to this puzzle. Kondo attributed the phenomenon to the scattering of the electrons due to the spin-interaction with a small concentration of magnetic impurities in the metal. To describe it he proposed the following interaction Hamiltonian

\begin{align}
H_K &= 2J\hat{\textbf{S}}\cdot \hat{\textbf{s}} \\
&=  J (2S_z s_z + S_+s_- +S_-s_+),
\end{align}
with $S_\pm = S_x \pm iS_y$. The Hamiltonian $H_K$ which is better known as the Kondo s-d model describes the spin interaction between the spin of the impurity $\hat{\textbf{S}}$ and the spin of the particles in the metal $\hat{\textbf{s}}$.

Kondo took $H_K$ as a perturbation of the electron gas in the metallic lead, with $J$ the perturbation parameter. While the first order led to no important contribution, Kondo was able to obtain on second order perturbation theory a logarithmic correction on the temperature in the resistivity of the form 

\begin{equation}
\rho_{imp} \propto \ln{\frac {
T_K }{T}},
\end{equation}
where $T_K$ received the name of Kondo temperature. Summing up this term to the other resistivity contributions we obtain the full expression 
\begin{equation}
{\displaystyle \rho_{metal} (T)=\rho_{imp}+a_{e}T^{2}+b_{Phonon}T^{5} + c_{m}\ln {\frac {
T_K }{T}}}.
\label{logKondo}
\end{equation}
\noindent When $T< T_K$ the term $ \ln {\frac {
T_K }{T}}$ increases. Eventually, it compensate the decaying resistivity which finally explained the  resistance minimum. 

Although Kondo's explanation was initially very successful it also presented a troublesome outcome. The logarithmic term introduced by Kondo diverges when the temperature approximates to $0$, hence proving to be inefficient at temperatures well bellow $T_K$. Going to the following orders in perturbation theory also led to divergent contributions to the  resistivity. This led physicists  to explore non-perturbative approaches to solve the Kondo effect. 

By that time, Anderson had already created his famous impurity model. One of his main contributions was the inclusion of the Hubbard term to represent the Coulomb interaction inside the dot, which proofed to be fundamental to understand the Kondo effect.Nonetheless, the Anderson model was a huge numerical challenge. The problem was finally solved by Kenneth Wilson, who was able to effectively diagonalize the Anderson model using a numerical method that combines ideas from scalability and the renormalization group. 

Wilson's explanation solved the Kondo problem almost completely. It turned out that bellow the Kondo temperature \cite{sindel_numerical_2005}, which is around
\begin{equation}
k_BT_K = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{U\Gamma}e^{\epsilon(\epsilon+U)/\Gamma U} ,
\end{equation}

\noindent the impurity entangles with the low-energy electrons forming a strongly correlated many-body singlet. This singlet surrounds the impurity in an structure formed by alternating regions of spin-$\up$ and spin-$\dw$ particles called the Kondo cloud (See \ref{fig:Kondo}(b)). The Kondo cloud was the first evidence of an entangled many body state, and is predicted to have an astonishing correlation length between $0.1\mu m$ to $10 \mu m$. This is a huge number if we think that the impurity(or QD) can have a radius bellow $1nm$. Finally, the minimum in the resistivity is produced when the conduction electrons scatter with the Kondo cloud. 

\subsection{Kondo Effect in QDs}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}


  The problem of magnetic impurities in metals can be treated using the Anderson model in a similar form as the transport in quantum dots. Hence, it is not a surprise that the Kondo Effect could also occur these systems. In 1998 the technological advances allowed the observation of the Kondo effect for the first time in a single electro transistor \cite{goldhaber-gordon_kondo_1998}. When an odd number of electrons is in the QD the last level bellow the Fermi energy is half-occupied, so that the dot can be considered as a magnetic impurity. The unlocalized electrons in the reservoirs then interact with this localized electron. Spin-exchange can occur as it happened with  magnetic impurities in metals. At low temperatures, this magnetic  interaction gives rise to strong quantum correlations that favor the formation of a singlet state between the localized electron and the electrons in the leads. As a result, the zero-bias density of states is increased producing a zero-bias conductance peak \ref{fig:ExpKondo}(b). 

Note that the physical implications of the Kondo effect  are different in magnetic impurities in metals and in QDs. In fact, they are complete opposite. While in magnetic impurities the resistivity increase, the Kondo effect in QD's leads no an unexpected raised in the zero-bias conductivity. The reason for this disagreement between both situations are the are the system dimensions. The scattering against a Kondo singlet in a  $3$D or $2$D systems against magnetic impurities is an obstacle to the conducting electrons. Instead, scattering in 1D-devices enhances the conductivity of the QD because there is only one scattering direction.

 As we previously discussed in \ref{sec:trans}, zero-bias transport in quantum dots can only occur if there is a state at the Fermi energy.  The Kondo effect creates a zero bias peak that is present whenever the dot has odd electrons . This explains the zero-bias plateaus observed in \ref{fig:ExpKondo}(a). We may think that the new singlet at the Fermi energy is creating a "channel" that allows quantum transport between both sides of the dot. This explains the Kondo peak. 

 In the following chapters we will give more details about this zero-energy-mode and theory that  explained it: The numerical renormalization group.  
















% The next part of thess preliminaries will be to compute the conductivity
% through the QD as a function of the gate voltage.
% In regular metals the Kondo effect manifests as a drop in conductivity
% under a certain Kondo temperature $(T_{Kondo})$ due to spin- scattering
% between the conduction electrons and the impurities of the material.
% The Anderson models, hence the NRG, are the perfect tools to study
% the physics of impurieties. Thus the computations we previously developed
% in this chapter will provide the right formalism to introduce the
% Kondo physics. This study will be an important part of the prelimiraries
% in the final document.
