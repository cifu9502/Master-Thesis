	abstract = {This review covers several topics involving renormalization group ideas. The solution of the s-wave Kondo Hamiltonian, describing a single magnetic impurity in a nonmagnetic metal, is explained in detail. See Secs. {VII}-{IX}. "Block spin" methods, applied to the two dimensional Ising model, are explained in Sec. {VI}. The first three sections give a relatively short review of basic renormalization group ideas, mainly in the context of critical phenomena. The relationship of the modern renormalization group to the older problems of divergences in statistical mechanics and field theory and field theoretic renormalization is discussed in Sec. {IV}. In Sec. V the special case of "marginal variables" is discussed in detail, along with the relationship of the modern renormalization group to its original formulation by Gell-Mann and Low and others.},

	abstract = {Quantum Dot Heterostructures Dieter Bimberg, Marius Grundmann and Nikolai N. Ledentsov Institute of Solid State Physics, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany Quantum dots are nanometer-size semiconductor structures, and represent one of the most rapidly developing areas of current semiconductor research as increases in the speed and decreases in the size of semiconductor devices become more important. They present the utmost challenge to semiconductor technology, making possible fascinating novel devices. This important new reference book focuses on the key phenomena and principles. Chapter 1 provides a brief account of the history of quantum dots, whilst the second chapter surveys the various fabrication techniques used in the past two decades, and introduces the concept of self-organized growth. This topic is expanded in the following chapter, which presents a broad review of self-organization phenomena at surfaces of crystals. Experimental results on growth of quantum dot structures in many different systems and on their structural characterization are presented in Chapter 4. Basic properties of the dots relate to their geometric structure and chemical composition. Numerical modeling of the electronic and optical properties of real dots is presented in Chapter 5, together with general theoretical considerations on carrier capture, relaxation, recombination and properties of quantum dot lasers. Chapters 6 and 7 summarize experimental results on electronic, optical and electrical properties. The book concludes by disoussing highly topical results on quantum-dot-based photonic devices - mainly quantum dot lasers. Quantum Dot Heterostructures is written by some of the key researchers who have contributed significantly to the development of the field, and have pioneered both the theoretical understanding of quantum dot related phenomena and quantum dot lasers. It is of great interest to graduate and postgraduate students, and to researchers in semiconductor physics and technology and optoelectronics.},

	volume = {B21},
	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevB.21.1003},
	abstract = {The temperature-dependent impurity susceptibility for the symmetric Anderson model is calculated for all physically relevant values of its parameters U (the Coulomb correlation energy) and Γ (the impurity-level width). It is shown that, when U{\textgreater}πΓ, for temperatures T{\textless}U(10kB) the symmetric Anderson model exhibits a local moment and that its susceptibility maps neatly onto that of the spin-½ Kondo model with an effective coupling given by ρJeff=−8{ΓπU}. Furthermore, this mapping is shown for remarkably large values of {\textbar}ρJeff{\textbar}. At very low temperatures (much smaller than the Kondo temperature) the local moment is frozen out, just as for the Kondo model, leading to a strong-coupling regime of constant susceptibility at zero termperature. The results also depict the formation of a local moment from the free orbital as T drops below U, a feature not present in the Kondo model. Finally, when U≪πΓ there is a direct transition from free-orbital regime for T≫Γ to the strong-coupling regime for T≪Γ. The calculations were performed using the numerical renormalization group originally developed by Wilson for the Kondo problem. In addition to the actual numerical calculations, analytic results are presented. In particular, the effective Hamiltonians, i.e., fixed-point Hamiltonian plus relevant and marginal operators, are constructed for the free-orbital, local-moment, and strong-coupling regimes. Analytic formulas for the impurity susceptibility and free energy in all three regimes are developed. The impurity specfic heat in the strong-coupling regime is calculated.},

	abstract = {In this thesis we summarize a number of theoretical studies
dealing with various properties of quantum dots.
Small quantum dots with a large level spacing
are very well described by the Anderson impurity model.
In modern quantum dot experiments all parameters of this model can be tuned via external gate voltages. Thus, it should be possible to check our theoretical findings experimentally. 
We are particularly interested in temperatures \$T\$ smaller than the so-called Kondo temperature \$T\_K\$, \$T{\textless}T\_K\$. The Kondo temperature \$T\_K\$ is an energy scale below
which a local spin inside the dot interacts strongly with the conduction electrons in its neighboring leads.
Consequently we employ Wilson's numerical renormalization group method, a numerical technique which allows for an accurate calculation of properties of quantum dots in the Kondo regime.},

	abstract = {The partition function of a two-dimensional "ferromagnetic" with scalar "spins" (Ising model) is computed rigorously for the case of vanishing field. The eigenwert problem involved in the corresponding computation for a long strip crystal of finite width (n atoms), joined straight to itself around a cylinder, is solved by direct product decomposition; in the special case n=∞ an integral replaces a sum. The choice of different interaction energies (±J,±J′) in the (0 1) and (1 0) directions does not complicate the problem. The two-way infinite crystal has an order-disorder transition at a temperature T=Tc given by the condition sinh(2JkTc) sinh(2J′{kTc})=1. The energy is a continuous function of T; but the specific heat becomes infinite as −log {\textbar}T−Tc{\textbar}. For strips of finite width, the maximum of the specific heat increases linearly with log n. The order-converting dual transformation invented by Kramers and Wannier effects a simple automorphism of the basis of the quaternion algebra which is natural to the problem in hand. In addition to the thermodynamic properties of the massive crystal, the free energy of a (0 1) boundary between areas of opposite order is computed; on this basis the mean ordered length of a strip crystal is (exp (2JkT) tanh(2J′{kT}))n.},

	abstract = {The conditions necessary in metals for the presence or absence of localized moments on solute ions containing inner shell electrons are analyzed. A self-consistent Hartree-Fock treatment shows that there is a sharp transition between the magnetic state and the nonmagnetic state, depending on the density of states of free electrons, the s−d admixture matrix elements, and the Coulomb correlation integral in the d shell; that in the magnetic state the d polarization can be reduced rather severely to nonintegral values, without appreciable free electron polarization because of a compensation effect; and that in the nonmagnetic state the virtual localized d level tends to lie near the Fermi surface. It is emphasized that the condition for the magnetic state depends on the Coulomb (i.e., exchange self-energy) integral, and that the usual type of exchange alone is not large enough in d-shell ions to allow magnetic moments to be present. We show that the susceptibility and specific heat due to the inner shell electrons show strongly contrasting behavior even in the nonmagnetic state. A calculation including degenerate d orbitals and d−d exchange shows that the orbital angular momentum can be quenched, even when localized spin moments exist, and even on an isolated magnetic atom, by kinetic energy effects.},

When applied to the Kondo problem, this numerical renormalization group ({NRG}) method gave for the first time the full crossover from the high-temperature phase of a free spin to the low-temperature phase of a completely screened spin. The {NRG} method was later generalized to a variety of quantum impurity problems. The purpose of this review is to give a brief introduction to the {NRG} method, including some guidelines for calculating physical quantities, and to survey the development of the {NRG} method and its various applications over the last 30 years. These applications include variants of the original Kondo problem such as the non-Fermi-liquid behavior in the two-channel Kondo model, dissipative quantum systems such as the spin-boson model, and lattice systems in the framework of the dynamical mean-field theory.},
