	abstract = {Spatial separation of Majorana zero modes distinguishes trivial from topological midgap states and is key to topological protection in quantum computing applications. Although signatures of Majorana zero modes in tunneling spectroscopy have been reported in numerous studies, a quantitative measure of the degree of separation, or nonlocality, of the emergent zero modes has not been reported. Here, we present results of an experimental study of nonlocality of emergent zero modes in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid nanowire devices. The approach takes advantage of recent theory showing that nonlocality can be measured from splitting due to hybridization of the zero mode in resonance with a quantum dot state at one end of the nanowire. From these splittings as well as anticrossing of the dot states, measured for even and odd occupied quantum dot states, we extract both the degree of nonlocality of the emergent zero mode, as well as the spin canting angles of the nonlocal zero mode. Depending on the device measured, we obtain either a moderate degree of nonlocality, suggesting a partially separated Andreev subgap state, or a highly nonlocal state consistent with a well-developed Majorana mode.},

Such a system has been originally proposed without Coulomb interaction in Dessotti et al. (2014 [16]) . Our findings reveal that for dots in resonance, the ratio between the strength of Coulomb repulsion and the dot-wire coupling changes the width of the Majorana zero-bias peak for both Fano regimes studied, indicating thus that the electronic interdots correlation influences the Majorana state lifetime in the dot hybridized with the wire. Moreover, for the off-resonance case, the swap between the energy levels of the dots also modifies the width of the Majorana peak, which does not happen for the noninteracting case. The results obtained here can guide experimentalists that pursuit a way of revealing Majorana signatures."

Another feature is topologically protected gates generated through braiding of Majorana bound states (MBSs). However, braiding requires structures with branched topological segments which have inherent difficulties in the semiconductor–superconductor heterostructures now believed to host MBSs. In this paper, we construct quantum bits taking advantage of the topological protection and non-local properties of MBSs in a network of parallel wires, but without relying on braiding for quantum gates. The elementary unit is made from three topological wires, two wires coupled by a trivial superconductor and the third acting as an interference arm. Coulomb blockade of the combined wires spawns a fractionalized spin, non-locally addressable by quantum dots used for single-qubit readout, initialization, and manipulation. We describe how the same tools allow for measurement-based implementation of the Clifford gates, in total making the architecture universal. Proof-of-principle demonstration of topologically protected qubits using existing techniques is therefore within reach.}

By controlling the interdot coupling we can drive the system from two single (uncoupled) quantum dots to double (coupled) dot system configurations. We employ a recursive Green’s function technique that provides us with numerically exact results for the local density of states of the system. We first show that in the uncoupled dot configuration (single dot behavior) the Majorana and the Andreev bound states appear in an individual dot in two completely distinct regimes. Therefore, they cannot coexist in the single quantum dot system. We then study the coexistence of these states in the coupled double dot configuration. In this situation we show that in the trivial phase of SC2, the Andreev states are bound to an individual quantum dot in the atomic regime (weak interdot coupling) or extended over the entire molecule in the molecular regime (strong interdot coupling). More interesting features are actually seen in the topological phase of SC2. In this case, in the atomic limit, the Andreev states appear bound to one of the quantum dots while a Majorana zero mode appears in the other one. In the molecular regime, on the other hand, the Andreev bound states take over the entire molecule while the Majorana state remains always bound to one of the quantum dots.}

Using the method of full counting statistics we calculate the conductance and the zero-frequency noise. Using an effective low-energy model, we analyze in detail the Andreev reflection probability as a function of the various system parameters and show that it exhibits a Fano resonance (FR) line shape in the case of a weakly coupled QD as a function of the QD energy level when the two MBS overlap. The asymmetry parameter changes sign as the bias voltage is tuned through the MBS overlap energy. The FR is mirrored as a function of the QD level energy as long as tunneling from the dot to the more distant MBS is negligible. However, if both MBS are coupled to the lead and the QD, the height as well as the asymmetry of the line shapes cease to respect this symmetry. These two exclusive cases uniquely distinguish the coupling to a MBS from the coupling to a fermionic bound state that is shared between the two MBS. We complement the analysis by employing a discretized one-dimensional p-wave superconductor (Kitaev chain) for the quantum wire and show that the features of the effective low-energy model are robust towards a more complete Hamiltonian and also persist at finite temperature.},

Majorana bound states ({MBSs}) are peculiar quasiparticles that may one day become the cornerstone of topological quantum computing. To engineer these states, physicists have used semiconductor nanowires in contact with a superconductor. Although many of the observed properties align with theoretical predictions, a closer look into the creation of {MBSs} is desirable. Deng et al. fabricated nanowires with a quantum dot at one end that served as a spectrometer for the states that formed inside the superconducting gap of the nanowire. Using this setup, topologically trivial bound states were seen to coalesce into {MBSs} as the magnetic field was varied.
Science, this issue p. 1557
Hybrid nanowires combining semiconductor and superconductor materials appear well suited for the creation, detection, and control of Majorana bound states ({MBSs}). We demonstrate the emergence of {MBSs} from coalescing Andreev bound states ({ABSs}) in a hybrid {InAs} nanowire with epitaxial Al, using a quantum dot at the end of the nanowire as a spectrometer. Electrostatic gating tuned the nanowire density to a regime of one or a few {ABSs}. In an applied axial magnetic field, a topological phase emerges in which {ABSs} move to zero energy and remain there, forming {MBSs}. We observed hybridization of the {MBS} with the end-dot bound state, which is in agreement with a numerical model. The {ABS}/{MBS} spectra provide parameters that are useful for understanding topological superconductivity in this system.

	abstract = {We investigate the dynamical and transport features of a Kondo dot side coupled to a topological superconductor ({TS}). The Majorana fermion states ({MFSs}) formed at the ends of the {TS} are found to be able to alter the Kondo physics profoundly: For an infinitely long wire where the {MFSs} do not overlap (εm=0) a finite dot-{MFS} coupling (Γm) reduces the unitary-limit value of the linear conductance by exactly a factor 3/4 in the weak-coupling regime (Γm{\textless}{TK}), where {TK} is the Kondo temperature. In the strong-coupling regime (Γm{\textgreater}{TK}), on the other hand, the spin-split Kondo resonance takes place due to the {MFS}-induced Zeeman splitting, which is a genuine many-body effect of the strong Coulomb interaction and the topological superconductivity. We find that the original Kondo resonance is fully restored once the {MFSs} are strongly hybridized (εm{\textgreater}Γm). This unusual interaction between the Kondo effect and the {MFS} can thus serve to detect the Majorana fermions unambiguously and quantify the degree of overlap between the {MFSs} in the {TS}.},

When the strength of the Majorana fermion coupling exceeds the temperature T, this combination of Kondo-Majorana fermion physics might be amenable for an experimental test: The usual peak of the temperature dependent zero bias conductance σ(V=0,T) splits and the conductance has a dip at T=0. The heights of the conductance side peaks decrease with magnetic field.},

	abstract = {We have recently shown [Phys. Rev. B 89, 165314 (2014)] that a noninteracting quantum dot coupled to a one-dimensional topological superconductor and to normal leads can sustain a Majorana mode even when the dot is expected to be empty, i.e., when the dot energy level is far above the Fermi level of the leads. This is due to the Majorana bound state of the wire leaking into the quantum dot. Here we extend this previous work by investigating the low-temperature quantum transport through an interacting quantum dot connected to source and drain leads and side coupled to a topological wire. We explore the signatures of a Majorana zero mode leaking into the quantum dot for a wide range of dot parameters, using a recursive Green's function approach. We then study the Kondo regime using numerical renormalization group calculations. We observe the interplay between the Majorana mode and the Kondo effect for different dot-wire coupling strengths, gate voltages, and Zeeman fields. Our results show that a “0.5” conductance signature appears in the dot despite the interplay between the leaked Majorana mode and the Kondo effect. This robust feature persists for a wide range of dot parameters, even when the Kondo correlations are suppressed by Zeeman fields and/or gate voltages. The Kondo effect, on the other hand, is suppressed by both Zeeman fields and gate voltages. We show that the zero-bias conductance as a function of the magnetic field follows a well-known universality curve. This can be measured experimentally, and we propose that the universal conductance drop followed by a persistent conductance of 0.5e2/h is evidence of the presence of Majorana-Kondo physics. These results confirm that this “0.5” Majorana signature in the dot remains even in the presence of the Kondo effect.},
