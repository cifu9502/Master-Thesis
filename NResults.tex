In this section we present the results for the NRG analysis of the Anderson model applied to the case of a Double Quantum Dot (DQD) attached to a Majorana mode (See \ref{fig:GeneralModel}). The general Hamiltonian is   

\begin{equation}
H =\sum_{i,k,\sigma}\left(\epsilon_{di}+\frac{U_i}{2}\right)d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{i\sigma}+ \frac{U_i}{2}(d_{i \sigma}^{\dagger}d_{i \sigma}-1)^{2} + t_i(\gamma d_{+,\dw}+d^\dagger_{+,\dw}\gamma) + \Gamma_i(d^\dagger_{i\sigma}c_{k\sigma}+c^\dagger_{k\sigma}d_{i\sigma}).
\label{General model}
\end{equation}

In order to understand the physical properties of this model, we probed a set of thought processes. The main variable in this anylisis is the Density of States.  We  will observe its evolution on both QDs under the tuning of the model parameters such as:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Hopping between Dots and Majorana Mode ($t_1 , t_2$). 
    \item Gate voltage ($\ed{1} , \ed{2} $)
    \item Inter dot coupling ($t_{dots}$)
\end{enumerate}

These processes intend to show whether it is possible to "manipulate" the majorana mode inside the dots by tuning the established parameters.

\section{Attaching the Majorana mode to the DQD (Tuning $t_1=t_2$) \label{sec:t1=t2}}

\textbf{Parameters:}

$$\Gamma \sim 2.83*10^{-2}D, t_{dots}=0 , U_{1,2} = -2\ed{1,2} = 0.5$$
$$t_1=t_2 \in [0\  ,\  2.5*10^{-2}D]$$

\end{figure}



The first process consists in attaching the Majorana mode to both Quantum Dots symmetrically. For this, we scale up the coupling parameter $t_1=t_2$ from $0$ (Decoupled) to $0.02$ (Completely coupled).The other parameters where chosen with an equilibrium between the dot energy and Coulomb repulsion $(\ed{1,2}=-\frac{U_{1,2}}{2})$  and  without inter-dot coupling $t_{dots}=0$. These circumstances guarantee that the system preserves Particle Hole Symmetry (PHS). Thus the Density of States (DOS) of particles and holes remains equal at all instances $(\rho(-\omega) = \rho(\omega))$. \\

For $t_1=t_2>0$ spin-$\up$ and spin-$\dw$ DOS split near the order of $\vert \omega \vert \sim t_1,2 $. At the Fermi energy $(\omega =0)$  $\rho_\up = 2\rho_\dw$ due to the presence of the MZM in both QDs. }
\end{figure}

In the case where the majorana is detached from the DQD $(t_1 =t_2 = 0)$, the system favors the appearance of a three-peak at low energies as it is shown in \ref{fig:t1=t2/logplot} . The central peak is produced only by the Kondo effect and the two other satellite peaks are the result of a strong correlation between both dots caused by the indirect exchange of quantum states through the Lead (More information in ABSTRACT (MISSING)). \\

Once the MZM the spin-$\up$ and spin-$\dw$ DOS split at low energies due to the new spin-$\dw$ transport channel through the Majorana mode. The spin-$\dw$ DOS at the Fermi energy ($\omega =0$) decays to the half of the spin-$\up$ DOS $\rho_\dw = \frac{\rho_\up}{2} $. By symmetry in the dot parameters this event occurs equally for both QDs. We adopt this fact as a Majorana signature. Hence we obtain that the MZM leaks inside both quantum dots. 

There is also an additional effect caused by the indirect exchange between the QDs through the Majorana mode . The consequences of this effect depend on the energy range of the majorana couplings $t_1=t_2$.  : 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $t_1=t_2 \ll \Gamma $ two more satellites are formed at very low energies ($\sim t_1$) in the spin-$\dw$ DOS (See  \ref{fig:2D/Shift_t1=t2} Spin-down $\omega \sim 10^{-3}D$ ). (See  \ref{fig:2D/Shift_t1=t2} Spin $\up$, $\omega \sim 10^{-3}D$ ).
    \item If $t_1=t_2 \sim \Gamma$ , the MZM contributes to the the growth of the spin-up satellites in the DOS. This effect produces the splitting between the spin-up and spin-down DOS.   (See  \ref{fig:2D/Shift_t1=t2} Spin-$\dw$, $\omega \sim 10^{-2}D$).
\end{enumerate}








\iffalse
At low energies $(\omega/D \sim 10^{-2})$ \ref{fig:2D/Shift_t1=t2} shows the emergence of a 3-peak in the DOS close to the Fermi energy. This 3-peak is formed by a central peak defined by the Kondo (spin $\up$) and the Majorana (spin $\dw$) peaks. The other two peaks are generated by an indirect exchange of the states between the quantum dots through the leads (SEE ABSTRACT). At even lower energies $(\omega/D \sim 10^{-4})$ it is possible to appreciate the emergence of another 3-peak in the spin down DOS which is present only for small values of the Majorana coupling constants $t_1 = t_2 \ll 0.01D$ (See  \ref{fig:t1=t2/logplot}). These sided peaks are caused by the indirect exchange between both dots through the Majorana Mode. When the Majorana couplings achieve the same order of the dot-lead coupling $\Gamma$ $(t_1 = t_2 \sim  0.01D)$ both sided peaks are merged causing the extinction of the majorana side-peaks and the increase of the indirect exchange peaks at $(\omega/D \sim 10^{-2})$.

\section{Transferring the MZM through gate voltage shifting $\ed{2}$. \label{sec:e2}}

\textbf{Parameters:}

$$\Gamma \sim 2.83*10^{-2}D, t_{dots}=0 , U_{1,2} = -2\ed{1} = 0.5 , t_1=t_2=0.0025$$
$$\ed{2} \in [-0.25 \  , -0.05]$$

This process starts with the DQD coupled symmetrically  to the Majorana mode, just as in \ref{sec:t1=t2}. The idea of this process is to break PHS by increasing the energy of the second QD $\ed{2}$. This procedure should induce the Majorana to tunnel only into the first dot. 


\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{IMAGES/ed2/2D.png}
\caption{\label{fig:2D/Shift_ed2} Evolution of the DOS of both QDs through the $\ed{2}$ tuning. UP: QD1. DOWN: QD2. LEFT: Spin $\up$. RIGHT: Spin $\dw$.}
\end{figure}


In \ref{fig:2D/Shift_ed2} we observe that both, the Kondo and the MZM peaks are preserved in the first QD as well as the majorana signature (See \ref{fig:ed2/Fermi}) when $\ed{2}$ is scaled up to $-0.1$.  However,  PHS breaking will favor the growth of the spin-$\up$ hole $(w>0)$  satellite and the spin-$\dw$ particle $(w<0)$ satellite.




In the second QD the DOS increases abruptly for both spins.The majorana signature is rapidly when  lost . Hence, with this set-up it is actually possible to induce the Majorana to preferably tunnel QD1 in despite of QD2.  \\

\caption{\label{fig:ed2/Fermi} As described in \ref{sec:t1=t2} the relation $\frac{\rho_\up(0)}{\rho_\up(0)}=2$ constitutes a Majorana Signature . This picture evaluates shows the evolution of the relation $\frac{\rho_\up(0)}{\rho_\up(0)}$ for both QDs. While QD2 losses rapidly the Majorana signature, QD1 maintains it till $\ed{2}\sim -0.1$.}

\end{figure}
We start again with the symmetric model with both QDs coupled to the Majorana mode, but this time the evolution is performed over $\ep_2=\frac{U}{2}$, such that the model is always Particle-Hole symmetric. This situation is very different from the previous model (\ref{sec:e2}) since the decaying of $U2$ 
equalizes the effect of increasing the dot energy. In \ref{fig:DOS/PHS-Shift_e2.png} we observe that the DOS of QD2 increases while the QD1's DOS decreases, just as it happened in \ref{sec:e2} . However, the Majorana signature remains at $2$ for both dots (See \ref{fig:MSig/PHS-Shift_e2}), meaning that the Majorana is not preferably induced to tunnel to any QD despite the lose of symmetry in the dot energy.

\fi
 In \ref{fig:DOS/Shift_t2D1} and \ref{fig:DOS/Shift_t2D1} we observe the evolution of DOS in the case where the second dot is smoothly connected to the Majorana, which is already attached to the first dot. The hopping parameter $t_2$ scales up to $0.015D$ where the model reaches the symmetry $t_2 = t_1$. The figures show that increasing $t_2$ leads to a drop in the DOS of QD1 while the DOS in QD2 is increased. In addition, the single peak in the first dot transforms into a three-peak due to the Majorana interference with the second dot. In \ref{fig:MSig/Shift_t2} we also observe that the reason between the zero up-down DOS  $\left(\frac{\rho_\up(0)}{\rho_\up(0)}\right)$ smoothly scales up to $2$ in QD2. At $t_2 =0.02$, when the  is completely symmetric, the Majorana signature appears in both quantum dots. Note that the relation $\frac{\rho_\up(0)}{\rho_\up(0)}$  is already close to $2$ at $t_2=0$. This implies that the second dot "feels" the Majorana even when it is not directly connected to the Majorana mode.
