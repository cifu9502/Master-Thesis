\noindent The idea of using Majorana islands formed by QDs coupled to topological superconducting wires has recently turned on new lights  into the fabrication of of quantum architectures \cite{barkeshli_physical_2015,karzig_scalable_2017}. The main insight  of this method is that todayâ€™s precise experimental control over the parameters of QDs -energy levels, tunneling couplings, etc.- offers the unique possibility of manipulating the Majorana modes inside multi-dot systems. The simplest case where Majorana manipulation is possible is in a double quantum dot. So far, no complete analysis of this basis case has been done. The purpose of this chapter is to fill this gap by realizing a full quantum transport study of the effects of coupling a Majorana mode with a double quantum dot. For this, we combine the ballistic transport and the NRG approach developed in \ref{chap: Methods}. 


% As previously stated in the , Majorana-QD  architectures turn on new lights to the area of topological quantum computing. 



% Using the ideas from the previous chapters we are going to test if it is possible to manipulate the Majorana zero mode in the double quantum dot.  

% In the previous chapter we observed the result of coupling a Majorana mode to a quantum dot. The Majorana signature characterized by a decay of the Fermi peak to the half of its original height is a



 We consider the model in \ref{fig:GeneralModel} which can be obtained from the combination of Hamiltonians of a QD-Majorana \eqref{eq:QD-Mham} and a DQD \eqref{eq:HDQD}. The Hamiltonian

\begin{equation}
H =\sum_{i=1}^2\sum_{k,\sigma}\left(\epsilon_{i}+\frac{U_i}{2}\right)d_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{i\sigma}+ \frac{U_i}{2}(d_{i \sigma}^{\dagger}d_{i \sigma}-1)^{2} + t_i(\gamma d_{i,\dw}+d^\dagger_{i,\dw}\gamma) + V_id^\dagger_{i\sigma}c_{k\sigma}+V_i^* c^\dagger_{k\sigma}d_{i\sigma}.

\section{Non-interacting case}


In order to understand the physical properties of this model, we probed a set of thought processes. The main variable in this analysis is the density of states.  We  will observe its evolution on both QDs under the tuning of the model parameters such as the majorana couplings ($t_1 , t_2$)  ,  gate voltages ($\ed{1} , \ed{2} $) and the inter dot coupling ($t_{dots}$). With these processes intend to show whether it is possible to "manipulate" the majorana modes inside the dots by tuning the established parameters. The number of possible combinations of parameters is huge and not all of them lead to important results. So on, we used the ballistic transport to select which arrangements could bring novel results. The most interesting models were simulated with NRG in the interacting case \ref{fig:Models}.  

\subsection{The Green function:}

%  To solve the transport equations using the graph method from \ref{sec:GraphMethod} first not that 
This new model is a combination the DQD graph (\ref{fig:graphDQD}) with the Majorana-QD graph \ref{fig:green-M-QD}.b). We can use the trick in \ref{sec:} to get rid of the of the Green function $\Green{f_\dw,d^\dagger_1}$ for the second Majorana operator. This allows us to obtain the following transport equations 
 
 
 
%  As we did previously in \ref{sec:GreenMaj-DQD} the transport equations for $f_\dw$ and $f^\dagger_\dw$ are 
% \begin{align}
%         \left(\omega-\epsilon_{M}\right)\Green{f_{\downarrow},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}}&=\frac{t}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\Green{d_{1\downarrow},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}}-\Green{d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}}\right) \\
%     \left(\omega+\epsilon_{M}\right)\Green{f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}}&=\frac{t}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\Green{d_{1\downarrow},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}}-\Green{d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}}\right),
% \end{align}
% \noindent which allows us to take $\Green{f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}} = \frac{\omega + \epsilon}{\omega -\epsilon}\Green{f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}} $. Therefore, we can eliminate $\Green{f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}} $ from the equations even before we start Gauss-Jordan process.
 
 \begin{equation}
     \left[\begin{array}{ccccccc}
\omega-\epsilon_{1} & -V_{1}^{*} & -t_{dots} & -T_{1} & 0 & 0 & 0\\

% ------------------------FIGURE GRAPH---------------------------
 The graph representing this equation is \ref{fig:Graph-MDQD}.a). Using the algorithm in \ref{sec:Algorithm} we start to popping the vertexes $c_k,c^\dagger_k, d_{2,\dw}$ and $ d^\dagger_{2,\dw}$ in that order. The energies associated to $d_{1,\dw}$ and $d^\dagger_{1,\dw}$ will be similar to the energy of the DQD \eqref{eq:EnDQD} giving 
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{DQD}^{\pm}=\pm\epsilon_{1}+\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{1}V_{1}^{*}}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}+\frac{\left\Vert \pm t_{dots}+\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{1}V_{2}^{*}}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}\right\Vert ^{2}}{\omega\pm\epsilon_{2}-\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{2}V_{2}^{*}}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}}. \label{eq:epDQD}
\end{equation}
\noindent There is also a correction in the couplings between the Majorana mode and $d_{1,\dw}$, $d^\dagger_{1,\dw}$ given by 

\begin{equation}
    T_{\pm}=\pm t_{1}\pm t_{2}\frac{\left(\pm t_{dots}+\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{1}V_{2}^{*}}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}\right)}{\omega\pm\epsilon_{2}\pm\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{2}V_{2}^{*}}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}}. \label{eq:T+-}
\end{equation}

In addition since the Majorana is in contact with dot $2$, there is an extra-term appearing in the  Majorana energy given by 
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{M2}=\omega-\epsilon_{M}-\frac{\frac{\omega}{\omega+\epsilon_{M}}\left\Vert t_{2}\right\Vert ^{2} } {\omega-\epsilon_{2}-\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{2}V_{2}^{*}}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}}-\frac{\frac{\omega}{\omega+\epsilon_{M}}\left\Vert t_{2}\right\Vert ^{2}}{\omega+\epsilon_{2}-\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{2}V_{2}^{*}}{\omega+\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}}. \label{eq:M2}
\end{equation}
It only remains to pop out vertexes $d^\dagger_1$ and $f_\dw$ in that order to obtain the green function 

\begin{equation}
    G_{{d_{1\downarrow},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}}}\left(\omega\right)=\frac{1}{\omega-\epsilon_{DQD}^{+}-\frac{\left\Vert T_{+}\right\Vert ^{2}}{\omega-\epsilon_{M2}-\frac{\left\Vert T_{-}\right\Vert ^{2}}{\epsilon_{DQD}^{-}}}}.
    \label{eq:Green_NonInteracting}
\end{equation}

This simple formula summarizes the transport information through the first dot of the non-interacting Majorana-DQD system.  To compute the DOS we just need to replace once again  $\sum \frac{V_1V^*_1}{\omega -\epsilon_k}= -i\Gamma_1$ as performed in \ref{sec:GraphMethod}. By plotting the final DOS in Mathematica we were able to observe the transitions of the Majorana mode while manipulating the model parameters.  

\subsection{MZM manipulation}
\begin{figure}[bt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{IMAGES/DQD-M/3Model.png}
\caption{\label{fig:MajoranaModels}. \protect\Source{By the Author}} 
\end{figure}

The density of states provides significant information about the presence of a Majorana zero modes in the dot. We characterize the Majorana signature by a robust zero-mode with two possible heights:
 \begin{itemize}
         \item \textbf{Type I: }  The spin-$\dw$ DOS is the half of the spin-$\up$ DOS  at the Fermi energy $(\rho_\dw(0)=\rho_\up(0))$. 
         \item \textbf{Type II: } A spin-$\dw$ zero mode of height $ \rho_\dw(0) = \frac{0.5}{\pi  \Gamma_1}$. 
     \end{itemize}
In our results we observe several times these two types of signatures. Type I often appears when there is a zero-mode in the spin-$\up$ DOS. Type II emerges in the remaining situations. 

We call MZM manipulation to the "movements" attributed to the Majorana signature under the tunning of the dot gate voltages $( \epsilon_1 , \epsilon_2 )$. This manipulation process is performed in three different set ups that are presented in Fig.\ref{fig:MajoranaModels} with definite values of $\Gamma_2$, $t_dots$, $t_1$ and $t_2$. In configuration (a), we coupled the QD symmetrically to the lead and the Majorana mode. With this setup we expect to break the localization of the MZM which should split and tunnel into both dots. In setups (b) and (c) we coupled the second dot indirectly through the first dot. Hence, quantum  interference should split the zero mode in two states. Our objective is to observe what occurs with the Majorana signature in this situation. There are two options to connect the MZM in this situation. Attached it directly through the first dot (b) or indirectly through the second dot (c).

 The non-interacting results for setups (a),(b) and (c) of FIG.\ref{fig:MajoranaModels} are shown at figures FIG.\ref{fig:t1=t2}, FIG.\ref{fig:t1>0} and FIG.\ref{fig:t2>0} respectively. Each figure depicts the DOS of dot $1$(left) and dot $2$(right). The gate voltage is initially $0$ in both dots at the first row. In the second row the gate voltage is turned on to  $\epsilon_1 = 5\Gamma_1$ in the first dot and remains at $\epsilon_2 = 0$ in the second dot. In the third row the first dot's voltage is off $\epsilon_1=0$ and we switch on the second dot with a negative voltage of $\epsilon_2 = -5\Gamma_1$. The insets at each row shows which dots exhibit Majorana signatures, depicted by a red dashed circle inside the dot. These images will continuously change under the tuning of gate voltages which represents the manipulation of the Majorana signature.



In FIG.\ref{fig:t1=t2} we observe the results for the symmetric coupling setup FIG.\ref{fig:MajoranaModels}(a). In the particle hole symmetric case (first row) the DOS is equal in both dots. Note that that the spin-$\dw$ (Thin red line) DOS is the half of the spin-$\up$ (Bold blue line) DOS at the Fermi energy $(\rho_\dw(0) = \frac{1}{2}\rho_\up(0))$. This type II Majorana signature is similar to the one observed when a single dot is coupled to a Majorana mode. \cite{liu_detecting_2011} We may conclude that the Majorana in tunneling inside both dots breaking the localization of the MZM. If a positive or negative gate voltage is induced in one of the dots, as shown in the second and third row of Figure \ref{fig:t1=t2}(c)-(f),  the Majorana zero mode vanishes from that dot. Meanwhile the density of states in the other dot increases while preserving the Majorana signature. This means that the MZM is actually being induced to "leave" this dots and leak into the other dot by the gate voltage activation. This first example of MZM manipulation.

Another example of MZM manipulation occurs when the second dot is not directly connected to the lead. In this case, the inter-dot tunneling generates quantum interference which finally destroys the central peak as observe in FIG.\ref{fig:t1>0}(a) at the spin-$\up$ DOS . The spin-$\dw$ channel at FIG.\ref{fig:t1>0}(a), which is coupled to the MZM, does not exhibit the characteristic Fermi peak either. Instead, the one half Majorana signature at the Fermi energy $(\rho_\dw(0) = \frac{1}{2}\rho_\up(0))$ appears clearly inside the second dot FIG.\ref{fig:t1>0}(b). This situation prevails when the first dot's gate voltage is turned on FIG.\ref{fig:t1>0}(c)\&(d). While the first dot does not seem to exhibit any type of Majorana signature, the second dot's spin-$\dw$ DOS exhibits a robust zero-mode of height $\frac{0.5}{\pi \Gamma}$. The results are more exciting when the second dot's gate voltage is turned on in FIG.\ref{fig:t1>0}(e)\&(f). These figures clearly show how the MZM, previously localized at the second dot, is induced to leave this dot and returned onto the first dot. Moreover, the DOS of spin-$\up$ and spin-$\dw$ channels are very similar to the spectral densities observed at FIG.\ref{fig:t1=t2}(d)(e), which means that the previous interference pattern has disappeared due to the presence of this gate voltage.

The results of the third configuration FIG.\ref{fig:MajoranaModels}(c) appear in FIG.\ref{fig:t2>0}. Contrary to what was observed in the previous case, this time the Majorana signature is not destroyed by the interference but instead, the  $\frac{0.5}{\pi \Gamma}$-height MZM emerges indirectly in the first dot. This is a perfect way to separate the Majorana's spin-$\dw$ DOS from the central spin-$\up$ zero-mode which is still destroyed by the interference. In addition, the second dot still exhibits a type I Majorana signature as observed in FIG.\ref{fig:t2>0}(b). In the second row we observe that turning on the gate voltage in dot $1$  destroys the Majorana signature in both dots FIG.\ref{fig:t2>0}(c)(d). On the other hand, if the second dot's voltage is switched both dots will preserve their Majorana signature (QD1:type I, QD2: type II), while the spin-$\up$ quantum interference vanishes in the first dot.






% In this part we will discuss the three models in figure \ref{fig:Models} which are particularly interesting for the exotic behavior of their Majorana signature. The parameters $(t_1,t_2, t_dots)$ are fixed in these three models and we will take $\ep_1$ and $\ep_2$ as variables. The first model(a), represents a symmetric coupling of the DQD with the lead and the Majorana mode. In models (b) and (c) the second dot is indirectly coupled to the system through the first dot. As already analyzed in \ref{sec:GreedDQD}, the quantum interference generated by this coupling will destroy the central peak. The Majorana fermion can be either connected to the first dot (b) or to the second dot (c). The system will exhibit different Majorana signatures depending on which dot is connected to the Majorana zero mode.   



% On each case we observe three different situations. 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item First Row: Zero bias. No gate $\ep_1 =\ep_2 = 0$.
%     \item Second Row: We turn on the first dot's gate voltage $\ep_1 = 5\Gamma_1, \ep_2 = 0$.
%     \item Third Row: We turn on the second dot's gate voltage $\ep_2 = -5\Gamma_1, \ep_1 = 0$.
% \end{itemize}

    

%     The density of states for the setup in \ref{fig:Models}.(a) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SymCoupling}. Since the model is non-interacting, spin-$\up$ and spin-$\dw$ models are independent. The spin-$\dw$ DOS (dashed line) shows the effects caused by the Majorana zero-mode in comparison with the spin-$\up$  results (solid line). In the particle hole symmetric (first line) the DOS is equal in both dots. Note that that the spin-$\dw$ DOS is the half of the spin-$DOS$ at the fermi energy $\rho_\dw(0) = \rho_\up(0)$. This Majorana signature is similar to the one observed in the single dot case \cite{liu_detecting_2011}. We may conclude that the Majorana tunnels inside both dots. If a positive or negative gate voltage is induced in one of the dots, as shown in the second and third row of Figure \ref{fig:SymCoupling},  the Majorana zero mode vanishes. Looking to the other dot we can also observe that the Majorana signature in the other dot recovers the form observed in the single dot-Majorana model. Thus, by activating the gate voltage in one of the dots it is possible to induce the majorana mode to leave to the other dot.  

    
     
%     If the second dot is not directly connected to the lead the induced tunneling between both dots generates a path difference that destroys the central peak (See FIG\ref{fig:Interference} spin-$\up$ line). We can then proceed to connect the Majorana to each one of these dots. FIG.\ref{fig:Interference} shows the results of connecting the MZM to the first dot. Note that at zero-bias, quantum interference  destroys the Majorana mode in the first dot. However, in the second dot the spin-$\dw$ DOS is the half of the spin-$\up$ DOS at the Fermi energy, which is a clear Majorana signature. Hence, in this kind of arrangement the Majorana mode is allocated in the second dot.  \ref{fig:Interference}(e),(f) show that it is possible to reestablish the initial Majorana signature in the first dot by applying a gate voltage to the second dot. On the other hand, turning on the first dot's gate voltage does not lead to a meaningful change in the Majorana signature \ref{fig:Interference}(c),(d). While the spin-$\dw$ DOS in the first dot is still $0$ at the Fermi energy, the second dot shows a $0.5$-height zero mode. Although the spin-$\up$ DOS does not double the density of states any more, this signal is robust and equal in height to a Majorana signature which supports our claim that it is indeed a Majorana mode. 
%     If the Majorana mode is connected to the first dot, this interference will destroy the Majorana signature in the first dot. Interestingly, it is possible to observe a clear Majorana signature in the second dot characterized by a half central peak in the spin-$dw$ DOS. While turning on the first dot gate voltage seems to destroy this Majorana signature, tuning the second dots gate voltage returns the Majorana signature to the first dot. 


%     We now get into the final case that is when the Majorana mode is coupled to the second dot which is indirectly attached to the lead through the first dot. In this case \ref{fig:IndirectCoupling}(a)(b) shows that the Majorana signature is present in both dots, despite the Majorana is not directly coupled to the first dot. Moreover, we can observe that the spin-$\dw$ DOS is equal to $0.5$ at the Fermi energy while the spin-$\up$ peak has been destroyed by the interference. After turning on the first gate voltage we observe that the Majorana signature is destroyed in both dots \ref{fig:IndirectCoupling}(c)(d). This is totally opposite the results of increasing the second dot voltage which creates an stable $0.5$ Majorana signature at the Fermi energy of both dots \ref{fig:IndirectCoupling}(e)(f). 






\section{Interacting Results \label{sec:DQD-M-Interacting}}

Now we consider a Coulomb repulsion energy of $U = 17\Gamma_1$ in both dots. The factor $ \frac{U_i}{2}(\sum_{\sigma} \hat{n}_{i\sigma}-1)^{2}$ in \eqref{eq:H_DQD} favors states with an odd number of electrons (and holes). In addition, particle-hole equilibrium is now achieved when $\left(\epsilon_{di}+\frac{U_i}{2}\right)\hat{n}_{i\sigma}$.  Any induced gate voltage must be considered as a shifting from this equilibrium point. FIG\ref{fig:NRG_Majorana} shows the DOS at both QDs for the symmetric coupling configuration \ref{fig:MajoranaModels}. The two peaks appearing at around $8.6\Gamma_1 = \frac{U_i}{2}$ represent the two energy levels spaced by the Coulomb repulsion factor $U$. The central spin-$\up$ peak is a consequence of the Kondo effect, \cite{hewson_kondo_1997,wilson_renormalization_1975}  while the two satellite peaks observed in the inset  are the result of the  RKKY indirect interaction between both dots.  \cite{ruderman_indirect_1954,kasuya_theory_1956,yosida_magnetic_1957} Moreover, the system presents a Majorana signature characterized by half spin-$\dw$ DOS at the Fermi energy $(\rho_\dw(0) = \frac{1}{2}\rho_\up(0))$  . Note, that in this case the Majorana signature coexists with the Kondo effect in the DQD as already predicted by Ruiz-Tijerina \textit{et al.} for a single dot. \cite{ruiz-tijerina_interaction_2015}


% If the two dots are interacting, with $U = 17.6\Gamma_1$, the spin-$\up$ density of states for the symmetric configuration (\ref{fig:Models}.(a)) is pretty similar to the DQD-symmetric model. The height of the central peak decays to $0.25$ and two new peaks appear corresponding to the dots anti-ferromagnetic interaction. In the spin-$\dw$ channel we can observe a zero mode with height equal to the half of the spin-$\up$ DOS. The effect of the Majorana coupling can be observed better on \ref{fig:2D/Shift_t1=t2}.

    In this part project we are interested in the physics at low energy scales $\omega \sim \Gamma_1 $ close to the Kondo and MZM temperature. At this scale we can observe simlar res results with the non-interacting results. For instance, FIG.\ref{fig:Nt1=t2} shows the NRG results for the symmetric setup in FIG.\ref{fig:MajoranaModels}(a). In agreement with the non-interacting results, both dots have type I Majorana signatures. These signatures can be manipulated by tuning one of the dot's gate voltage to induce the MZM to leak into the other dot. The DOS at figures FIG.\ref{fig:Nt1=t2}(d)(e) shows a type I Majorana signature with $\rho_\dw(0) \approx \frac{1}{2}\rho_\up(0))$. We observed that this Majorana signature is stable for adjustments of energies bellow the $6\Gamma_1$. At larger gate voltages the signal is  destroyed.

    In the second setup FIG.\ref{fig:MajoranaModels}(b), the NRG results in  FIG.\ref{fig:Nt1>0} exhibit Majorana signatures similar to the non-interacting case. In the first row, the Majorana signature is destroyed by quantum interference while the second dot presents a type I Majorana signature as can be observed in the inset of the second dot. The first difference occurs when the gate voltage is switch on the first dot. This time the Majorana mode jumps onto the first dot which presents a type I Majorana signature . If the voltages is switched on the second dot, a type 2 Majorana signature appears a very low energies in dot 1.

    Finally, FIG.\ref{fig:Nt2>0} show the NRG results for the last configuration FIG.\ref{fig:MajoranaModels}(c). Surprisingly, the indirectly attached MZM exhibits a robust type II Majorana signature in the first dot over a destroyed Kondo peak. This signature is stable under the gate voltage tuning. In addition, only the first in the particle hole symmetric case the second dot presents a type II Majorana signature (Inset FIG.\ref{fig:Nt2>0}(b)). The difference between this model and the other that leads to a stable signature in one of the dots occurs because the QD's in the (c) model are connected in series. Therefore, the Majorana mode will always prevail in the dot that is attached to the leads besides the application of gate voltages. This case is similar to the model of a single dot attached to a Majorana chain, where it is known that the Majorana signatures is not disturbed by the gate tuning.

\subsection*{c) Attaching the Majorana mode to the DQD (Tuning $t_1=t_2$) \label{sec:t1=t2}}

\textbf{Parameters:}

$$\Gamma \sim 2.83*10^{-2}D, t_{dots}=0 , U_{1,2} = -2\ed{1,2} = 0.5$$
$$t_1=t_2 \in [0\  ,\  2.5*10^{-2}D]$$

\begin{figure}[hbt]

\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{IMAGES/t1=t2/2D.png}
\caption{\label{fig:2D/Shift_t1=t2} Evolution of the DOS of both QDs through $t_1 = t_2$ tuning. UP: Energy scale $\omega \sim 10^{-2}D$. DOWN: Energy scale $\omega \sim 10^{-3}D$. LEFT: Spin $\up$. RIGHT: Spin $\dw$.}
\end{figure}



The first process consists in attaching the Majorana mode to both Quantum Dots symmetrically. For this, we scale up the coupling parameter $t_1=t_2$ from $0$ (Decoupled) to $0.02$ (Completely coupled).The other parameters where chosen with an equilibrium between the dot energy and Coulomb repulsion $(\ed{1,2}=-\frac{U_{1,2}}{2})$  and  without inter-dot coupling $t_{dots}=0$. These circumstances guarantee that the system preserves Particle Hole Symmetry (PHS). Thus the Density of States (DOS) of particles and holes remains equal at all instances $(\rho(-\omega) = \rho(\omega))$. \\

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{IMAGES/t1=t2/LogPlot.png}
\caption{\label{fig:t1=t2/logplot} Density of states at each QD of the horizontal dashed cuts in \ref{fig:2D/Shift_t1=t2}. The energy is in logarithmic scale.  For $t_1=t_2>0$ spin-$\up$ and spin-$\dw$ DOS split near the order of $\vert \omega \vert \sim t_1,2 $. At the Fermi energy $(\omega =0)$  $\rho_\up = 2\rho_\dw$ due to the presence of the MZM in both QDs. }
\end{figure}

In the case where the Majorana is detached from the DQD $(t_1 =t_2 = 0)$, the system favors the appearance of a three-peak at low energies as it is shown in \ref{fig:t1=t2/logplot} . The central peak is produced only by the Kondo effect and the two other satellite peaks are the result of a strong correlation between both dots caused by the indirect exchange of quantum states through the Lead \ref{sec:DoublePeak}. \\

Once the MZM the spin-$\up$ and spin-$\dw$ DOS split at low energies due to the new spin-$\dw$ transport channel through the Majorana mode. The spin-$\dw$ DOS at the Fermi energy ($\omega =0$) decays to the half of the spin-$\up$ DOS $\rho_\dw = \frac{\rho_\up}{2} $. By symmetry in the dot parameters this event occurs equally for both QDs. We adopt this fact as a Majorana signature. Hence we obtain that the MZM leaks inside both quantum dots. 

There is also an additional effect caused by the indirect exchange between the QDs through the Majorana mode . The consequences of this effect depend on the energy range of the Majorana couplings $t_1=t_2$.  : 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $t_1=t_2 \ll \Gamma $ two more satellites are formed at very low energies ($\sim t_1$) in the spin-$\dw$ DOS (See  \ref{fig:2D/Shift_t1=t2} Spin-down $\omega \sim 10^{-3}D$ ). (See  \ref{fig:2D/Shift_t1=t2} Spin $\up$, $\omega \sim 10^{-3}D$ ).
    \item If $t_1=t_2 \sim \Gamma$ , the MZM contributes to the the growth of the spin-up satellites in the DOS. This effect produces the splitting between the spin-up and spin-down DOS.   (See  \ref{fig:2D/Shift_t1=t2} Spin-$\dw$, $\omega \sim 10^{-2}D$).
\end{enumerate}









% At low energies $(\omega/D \sim 10^{-2})$ \ref{fig:2D/Shift_t1=t2} shows the emergence of a 3-peak in the DOS close to the Fermi energy. This 3-peak is formed by a central peak defined by the Kondo (spin $\up$) and the Majorana (spin $\dw$) peaks. The other two peaks are generated by an indirect exchange of the states between the quantum dots through the leads (SEE ABSTRACT). At even lower energies $(\omega/D \sim 10^{-4})$ it is possible to appreciate the emergence of another 3-peak in the spin down DOS which is present only for small values of the Majorana coupling constants $t_1 = t_2 \ll 0.01D$ (See  \ref{fig:t1=t2/logplot}). These sided peaks are caused by the indirect exchange between both dots through the Majorana Mode. When the Majorana couplings achieve the same order of the dot-lead coupling $\Gamma$ $(t_1 = t_2 \sim  0.01D)$ both sided peaks are merged causing the extinction of the majorana side-peaks and the increase of the indirect exchange peaks at $(\omega/D \sim 10^{-2})$.

\subsection{ e) Transferring the MZM through gate voltage shifting $\ed{2}$. \label{sec:e2}}

\textbf{Parameters:}

$$\Gamma \sim 2.83*10^{-2}D, t_{dots}=0 , U_{1,2} = -2\ed{1} = 0.5 , t_1=t_2=0.0025$$
$$\ed{2} \in [-0.25 \  , -0.05]$$

This process starts with the DQD coupled symmetrically  to the Majorana mode, just as in \ref{sec:t1=t2}. The idea of this process is to break PHS by increasing the energy of the second QD $\ed{2}$. This procedure should induce the Majorana to tunnel only into the first dot.

\end{figure}
% -------------------FIGURES EVOLUTION ED--------------------

In \ref{fig:2D/Shift_ed2} we observe that both, the Kondo and the MZM peaks are preserved in the first QD as well as the majorana signature (See \ref{fig:ed2/Fermi}) when $\ed{2}$ is scaled up to $-0.1$.  However,  PHS breaking will favor the growth of the spin-$\up$ hole $(w>0)$  satellite and the spin-$\dw$ particle $(w<0)$ satellite.




In the second QD the DOS increases abruptly for both spins.The majorana signature is rapidly when  lost . Hence, with this set-up it is actually possible to induce the Majorana to preferably tunnel QD1 in despite of QD2.  \\

\end{figure}
We start again with the symmetric model with both QDs coupled to the Majorana mode, but this time the evolution is performed over $\ep_2=\frac{U}{2}$, such that the model is always Particle-Hole symmetric. This situation is very different from the previous model (\ref{sec:e2}) since the decaying of $U2$ 
equalizes the effect of increasing the dot energy. In \ref{fig:DOS/PHS-Shift_e2.png} we observe that the DOS of QD2 increases while the QD1's DOS decreases, just as it happened in \ref{sec:e2} . However, the Majorana signature remains at $2$ for both dots , meaning that the Majorana is not preferably induced to tunnel to any QD despite the lose of symmetry in the dot energy.

\fi
 In \ref{fig:DOS/Shift_t2D1} and \ref{fig:DOS/Shift_t2D1} we observe the evolution of DOS in the case where the second dot is smoothly connected to the Majorana, which is already attached to the first dot. The hopping parameter $t_2$ scales up to $0.015D$ where the model reaches the symmetry $t_2 = t_1$. The figures show that increasing $t_2$ leads to a drop in the DOS of QD1 while the DOS in QD2 is increased. In addition, the single peak in the first dot transforms into a three-peak due to the Majorana interference with the second dot. In \ref{fig:MSig/Shift_t2} we also observe that the reason between the zero up-down DOS  $\left(\frac{\rho_\up(0)}{\rho_\up(0)}\right)$ smoothly scales up to $2$ in QD2. At $t_2 =0.02$, when the  is completely symmetric, the Majorana signature appears in both quantum dots. Note that the relation $\frac{\rho_\up(0)}{\rho_\up(0)}$  is already close to $2$ at $t_2=0$. This implies that the second dot "feels" the Majorana even when it is not directly connected to the Majorana mode. 















% To built the ballistic transport graph (See \ref{sec:GraphMethod}) we just need to think that our model is actually merging the DQD graph (\ref{fig:graphDQD}) with the Majorana (Figure \ref{fig:green-M-QD}.b)). No need to write the green transport equations . Note  in graph $\MDQD$ that the  green function  $\Green{d_{1\downarrow},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}}{\MDQD}$  is composed by the greeen function of the DQD $\left(\GreenG{d_{1\downarrow},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}}{\GDQD } \right)$ and the extra term added by the presence of the majorana opperator $f_\downarrow$. In the equations this is simply 

% \begin{equation}
%     \GreenG{d_{1\downarrow},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}}{\MDQD}=\left[\left(\GreenG{d_{1\downarrow},d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger}}{\GDQD } \right)^{-1}+\frac{\omega}{\omega+\epsilon_{M}}\frac{E_{d_{1\dw}f_{\dw}}^{\MDQD}}{\left[\GreenG{f_{\downarrow},f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}}{\MDQD-d_{1}}\right]^{-1}}\right]^{-1}.
% \end{equation}
% where 
% \begin{equation}
%     E_{d_{1\dw}f_{\dw}}^{\MDQD}=\left(t_{1}+t_{2}\frac{\left(t_{dots}+\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{1}V_{2}^{*}}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}\right)}{\omega-\epsilon_{2}-\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{2}V_{2}^{*}}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}}\right)\left(t_{1}^{*}+t_{2}^{*}\frac{\left(t_{dots}^{*}+\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{1}^{*}V_{2}}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}\right)}{\omega-\epsilon_{2}-\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{2}^{*}V_{2}}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}}\right).
% \end{equation}
% \Jesus{This fact is difficult to explain. I will need more plots and writing the appendix. For now I will leave here some results}

% We then need to compute $\GreenG{f_{\downarrow},f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}}{\MDQD-d_{1}}$ . This graph is much simple. The neighborhood of  $f_{\downarrow}$ in graph ${\MDQD-d_{1}}$ are $d_2$ (above) and the inverted DQD(bellow). These neighbors are disconnected, hence we can include the in the green function independently. The term above is simply the dot $d_{2\downarrow}$ connected with the lead . 
% \begin{equation}
%     \frac{\frac{\omega}{\omega+\epsilon_{M}}\left\Vert t_{2}\right\Vert ^{2}}{\omega-\epsilon_{2}-\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{2}V_{2}^{*}}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}}.
% \end{equation}

 
% The term generated by the connection of $f_{\downarrow}$  with the inverted $DQD$ is a bit more complicated. First we need to include the term given by the connection with  $d_{2\downarrow}^\dagger$ which is 

% The other term is the contact with the DQD which can be expressed as 
% \begin{equation}
%     \GreenG{f_{\downarrow},f_{\downarrow}^{\dagger}}{\MDQD-d_{1}}=\left[\omega-\epsilon_{M}-\frac{\frac{\omega}{\omega+\epsilon_{M}}\left\Vert t_{2}\right\Vert ^{2}}{\omega-\epsilon_{2}-\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{2}V_{2}^{*}}{\omega-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}}-\frac{\frac{\omega}{\omega+\epsilon_{M}}\left\Vert t_{2}\right\Vert ^{2}}{\omega+\epsilon_{2}-\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{V_{2}V_{2}^{*}}{\omega+\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}}}}-\frac{\omega}{\omega+\epsilon_{M}}\frac{E_{f_{\dw}d_{1\dw}^\dagger}^{\MDQD-d_1}}{\left[\GreenG{d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger},d_{1\downarrow}{\dagger}}{\MDQD-d_{1}-f_{\downarrow}}\right]^{-1}}\right]^{-1}.
% \end{equation}
% Now, note that that graph $\MDQD-d_{1}-f_{\downarrow}$ is actually a double quantum dot with negated couplings. Hence  $\GreenG{d_{1\downarrow}^{\dagger},d_{1\downarrow}{\dagger}}{\MDQD-d_{1}-f_{\downarrow}}$  satisfies the equation \eqref{eq:solGreen} but with variables $-t_{dots}, -t_1 , -t_2, -\ed{1}  , -\ed{2}$
